      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

      "content": "Musk wins appeal and restores 2018 Tesla pay deal worth $56 billion\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Delaware's Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package from Tesla, which was once valued at $56 billion. Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.”\n\nThe ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThis compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November.\n\nThe ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares.\n\nMusk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock.\n\nIn 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded.\n\nMusk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies.\n\nTesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands.\n\nIn November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales.\n\nTesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan.\n\nThe Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.",

Some sectors are looking very interesting to me right now too. I do want good growth, something that’ll outperform the S&amp;P or similar ETFs. \n\nMy main targets have been PAAS, SOFI, GOOGL, AMZN, RIVN and then an ETF like XEQT as a safety net. I think these can have a decent return for next year but I’d love any suggestions.",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

Instead of recreating the letters I will simply be linking them:\n\nhttps://theoraclesclassroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1966-Berkshire-AR.pdf\n\nKey Paragraph:\n\n&gt; In addition to the cyclical nature of our business, there are other reasons why a strong financial condition is advisable. As you have been advised previously, the Company has been searching for suitable acquisitions within, and conceivably without, the textile field. Although to date none has been successfully concluded, we continue to have an active interest in such acquisitions. The present state of the money market, in which funds are virtually unobtainable for acquisition purposes, makes it imperative that we have available the liquid assets with which to consummate such acquisitions, should the hoped-for opportunities present themselves. Present uncertainties such as war, tax rates and decreased level of business activity also all combine to emphasize the continuing need for a strong financial condition.\n\nHe is letting the shareholders know he is on the hunt for acquisitions \"within and without, the textile field.\" \n\nI think otherwise this year a big goal of his was soothing shareholders. This is the only time Berkshire Hathaway paid a dividend under his tenure, and there was also a buyback of 37% of its stock. It is celebrating that the numbers now look like the numbers from Berkshire's best years. From here on out excess capital will almost always get re-invested instead of returned to shareholders. It seems like he was throwing them a big bone after his takeover of the company to get them ready for him to take the business in an entirely new direction next year.",

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions. These bonds would likely be best suited in a retirement account due to the federal, state, and local tax implications.",

      "content": "Can someone explain this to me?\n\nSo, over the years of adding a little of my paycheck to a few mutual funds, I have had $8,500 in PBLAX. They have been providing fairly consistent returns. I was content. But, last week the capital gains payout came, which was $1,766, I had it automatically set up to reinvest. But lately, almost all of the profits of the investment in PBLAX have gone in the red.\n\nMy question is, why is it when they had a good enough year for a great payout on investment, did so many of my investments go into the red?",

Tech comes with larger volatility, but due to the length of my time horizon, would these swings still out perform the broad market over a longer time frame? Essentially will volatility drag erode the CAGR of heavy tech investment over 20 years compared to a diversified approach? ",

I don't know if this is old news or if this is something that might be the next sector that is trending other than semiconductors. In my opinion I think the tech side is slowing down and only so much can be innovated when it comes to GPUs, Semis, we are now seeing RAM prices go up with data centers being built. But with data centers being built rumor has it the US power grid can barely keep up with winter (Texas / Illinois specifically) and black outs in summer. \n\nI was eyeing a few energy stocks ($BE, FSLR, GEV, BESF ETF) but I was wondering if these are already priced in? Is energy sector something that is lacking or can money be made in this sector? \n\nI think FSLR will be slower as solar can only do so much. $BE might be the way to go, GEV looks like it has amazing potential and BESF ETF too but I don't have the data on whats comprised in that ETF. (FINVIZ Subscription ran out)\n\n$BE also crashed with the rumor when SPACE X goes public they will put data centers in space, but the argument is space is cold and imo that idea is far fetched just to get Space X in the spot light. \n\nA month ago I was eyeing data center construction stocks but now with the US infrastructure I think energy might be the next trending sector?

Is there any reason to choose different index funds for each of them?\n\nI started a Roth IRA in Robinhood when I felt competent enough to begin investing for my retirement. I created a personal brokerage account for more risky investments, like individual stocks, to try to beat my HYSA returns of 4%, which I’ve done. I got a new job that offers a Roth 401K, which I believe to be better than a traditional 401K from my research, and an HSA, which I am inclined to use due to my T1 Diabetes based on how beneficial they appear to be. My question is…\nIs there any reason to choose different specific investments for each portfolio, or should I just stick to the tried and true methods for each of them, such as “VOO &amp; chill” or similar?

Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)\n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?\n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. .\n\nBe aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research.

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Time Horizon:** Day | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 22:32:02\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Cautiously Bullish with Elevated Retail Skepticism**\nThe sentiment is bifurcated. **Institutional/professional channels (RSS News, Macro Data)** signal a bullish bias: stocks are climbing, a record options expiry ($7.1T) suggests high activity, and the VIX at 16.87 is subdued. However, **retail sentiment (Reddit)** is dominated by skepticism, confusion, and macro-economic anxiety. Themes include distrust of economic data, generational wealth disparity, and frustration with trading strategies (e.g., \"ThetaGang Goes Wrong\"). This divergence suggests the rally may be lacking broad-based retail conviction, potentially making it vulnerable to sentiment shifts.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES: Across All Sources**\n*   **Data Distrust & Economic Policy Skepticism:** Reddit highlights intense scrutiny of government data (\"assumes Zero Housing Inflation\"), while Bloomberg notes a strategist calling data \"very noisy.\" This erodes confidence in traditional economic indicators.\n*   **Retail Trading Focus & Meme Stock Nostalgia:** GameStop remains a persistent topic (price updates, Instagram activity). The mention of \"RKLB 🚀\" and options trading (\"First options contract\") confirms continued retail interest in high-beta, speculative plays.\n*   **Global Macro-Economic Maneuvering:** Key themes are **dollar strength** (vs. JPY confusion), **geopolitical industrial policy** (China's rare-earth exports, Modi's tariff shields), and **commodity oversupply** (oil prices falling).\n*   **Sector Rotation Narrative:** Bloomberg's \"Why This Bull Market Isn't All About Tech\" is a critical signal that the market leadership may be broadening.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Near-Term Catalyst:** The massive **$7.1 Trillion options expiry** (12/19) is a dominant technical and liquidity event, likely contributing to the day's upward price action and volatility compression.\n*   **Strong Dollar Signal:** The Reddit confusion on USD/JPY strength post-BOJ indicates a potent, perhaps misunderstood, macro trend of dollar resilience, impacting carry trades and multinational earnings.\n*   **Commodity Signal:** Bloomberg's headline on oil points to persistent **disinflationary pressure** from energy, supporting the \"soft landing\" narrative but pressuring the energy sector.\n*   **Credit Risk Signal:** **New Fortress Energy's** delinquent payments highlight rising stress in specific corporate credit areas, a risk factor amid high rates.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Sentiment Risk:** A significant gap exists between institutional market mechanics (bullish) and retail investor belief (bearish/skeptical). This is a contrarian warning; if institutional flows stall, retail sentiment offers no support.\n    2.  **Liquidity & Volatility Risk:** The post-options expiry environment (12/20+) could see a sharp drop in market liquidity and a potential spike in the VIX from its suppressed level.\n    3.  **Geopolitical/Policy Risk:** Escalating US tariffs and China's export restrictions on critical materials (rare-earth magnets) threaten supply chains and cost structures.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Sector Rotation:** The move away from a narrow tech-led rally creates opportunities in overlooked industrial, financial, or materials sectors.\n    2.  **Disinflation Trade:** Falling oil prices benefit transportation, consumer discretionary, and other cost-sensitive sectors.\n    3.  **Strategic M&A:** Japan's record deal-making boom signals value and corporate action opportunities in international markets.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n*   **SECTOR: Industrials & Materials** - Monitor for sustained rotation as the bull market broadens. Beneficiaries of non-tech narratives, capex cycles, and potential infrastructure spending.\n*   **SECTOR: Energy** - **Avoid/Caution.** The \"world awash in supply\" narrative is a powerful headwind. Any long positions here are contrarian against a strong fundamental trend.\n*   **SYMBOL: NVDA** - The 3.93% gain is notable, but its leadership is now being questioned by the broader market narrative. Watch for a test of its ability to hold gains if rotation accelerates.\n*   **MACRO: U.S. Dollar (DXY/UUP)** - The confused retail discussion on JPY strength is a signal. The dollar's trend appears robust. Favor dollar-sensitive plays (e.g., multinationals with strong domestic revenue) or consider FX hedges for international exposure.\n*   **WATCH: VIX Term Structure** - Post the 12/19 expiry, monitor for steepening or signs of backwardation. A rapid rise from ~17 would signal rising fear and a potential correction.\n*   **AVOID: High-Retail-Sentiment Speculative Plays (e.g., meme stocks, extreme options selling)** - The Reddit themes of \"ThetaGang Goes Wrong\" and persistent GameStop fixation are warning signs of poor risk-adjusted returns and potential for sudden, sharp reversals in these crowded trades.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is mechanically bullish but resting on a fragile sentiment foundation. The immediate post-expiry period is key. **Strategy:** Favor quality and sector diversification over speculative concentration. Prepare for potential volatility increase and continue hedging against a stronger dollar trend.",

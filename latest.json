It was a total failure everyone, this random news outlet says it backfired.\n\n“The famed retailer seemed proud of its chaotic day, but workers on social media complained of disrespectful and belligerent customers.” \n\nFirst off😂😂they used a photo of police in front of a GameStop from another story to make this story seem serious I guess. Then they went to the “sub that shall not be mentioned here” and used their quotes to deem the day a backfiring failure. It sure seemed like everyone was having fun on this sub. It must be so hard to live this life not being able to understand or take a joke.",

      "content": "Commerce to open up exports of Nvidia H200 chips to China\n\nSeeking a compromise over controlling exports to China, the US Department of Commerce will soon allow the export of powerful Nvidia GPUs that are roughly 18 months behind its most advanced offerings, according to a person with knowledge of the plan.\n\nThe move, which would send Nvidia H200s to China, seeks to find a middle ground between those who oppose exports of any advanced AI chips and those who worry that restrictions will merely hand the market to Chinese competitors. It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government, which has blocked imports of less powerful chips, such as Nvidia’s H20.\n\nThe move, which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, could bolster Nvidia’s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide.\n\nThe US enacted strict export restrictions under the Biden Administration in an effort to prevent China from catching up on AI. But some in the White House believe those restrictions have more or less failed, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n    \n[Source](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/08/2025/commerce-to-open-up-exports-of-nvidia-h200-chips-to-china)",

      "content": "Carvana $CVNA is Highly Fraudulent\n\nCredentials:  14 year automotive veteran.  15 year options trader\n\nBullet Points:\n\n1) Carvana’s profit margins are too good to be true.  The best companies in the industry don’t come close to their 19% gross profit margins.  \n\n2) The CEO of Carvana (Ernest Garcia III) Also owns a privately owned auto business named Drivetime.  Drivetime is a dumpster fire.\n\n3) Ernest Garcia III has been funneling his unwanted Carvana inventory to Drivetime to prop up Carvana’s earnings.  Drivetime overpays Carvana for this inventory and then takes the loss on their own balance sheets.\n\n4) Over the last few months Ernest Garcia III has been selling tens of millions of dollars of stock to keep Drivetime afloat\n\n5) Carvana has issued roughly 15.3 million shares over the last year.  At average $330 price this comes to roughly 5 Billion USD.  None of this reflects on the company’s financial report.  \n\nThesis:\n\nBased on CVNA October 2025 earnings report the company’s equity attributed to shareholders increased by 1B usd.\n\nIn the same period the company issued ~15.3 million shares worth over 5B usd.  None of this issuance reflects on the company’s balance sheets.  Healthy companies issue dividends and buy back stock.  Carvana has no dividend and has issued billions in stock solely to their core insiders.\n\nDrivetime (a company owned by Carvana’s CEO) has the worst inventory I have ever seen.  Thousands and thousands of cars that are absolutely overpriced garbage.  Some of the cars they have been sitting on for over 6 months.  \n\nIn October and September of 2025 Ernest Garcia III has sold roughly 82 million dollars of carvana stock.  \n\nI am not a private investigator, financial pro, or accountant, but to me the evidence is compelling that carvana’s results are being directly propped by DRIVETIME and once the Garcias have enriched themselves the real results will emerge.\n\nI plan to open short positions against CVNA in the next few weeks after they fully transition to the SP 500",

Waymo is one of the largest positions in Tiger’s 2024 fund.\n\nWaymo declined to comment.\n\nThis year, Waymo has also announced a slew of expansions, including its debut on freeways in three cities, and autonomous driving in cities including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando.\n\nThe latest milestone is also another sign that Waymo is continuing to push ahead of aspiring self-driving competitor Tesla, which has run limited pilots in Austin and operates a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area.\n\nTesla vehicles include human drivers or safety supervisors on board and are not driverless like Waymo’s fleet vehicles.\n\nAccording to Tesla’s latest earnings call, executives said the company hit a quarter of a million miles with its fleet in Austin, and more than one million in the Bay Area. In July, Waymo announced 100 million total fully autonomous miles.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html)",

      "content": "U.S. uncovers scheme to reroute Nvidia GPUs worth $160 million to China despite export bans\n\nU.S. authorities have detained two Chinese nationals accused of illegally exporting Nvidia chips to China and other restricted destinations. The arrests are part of a wider investigation into what officials say is a network designed to bypass U.S. export controls on advanced technology. Separately, a Houston-based company and its owner have already pleaded guilty to routing Nvidia hardware through shell buyers to evade restrictions. Investigators say the broader probe now involves more than $160 million worth of export-controlled tech. It’s another reminder of how tight controls around AI and high-end chips have become, and how aggressively enforcement is picking up as demand keeps rising.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/us-attorneys-office-southern-district-of-texas-prosecutors-nvidia-chips-h200-h100-smuggle-china.html?__source=androidappshare",

      "content": "Michael Saylor just pitched countries on creating Bitcoin backed digital banking systems and the concept is pretty wild.\n\nSpeaking in Abu Dhabi, Saylor laid out a vision where countries could use Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit to offer regulated bank accounts that give way higher returns than traditional deposits. He pointed out that banks in Japan, Europe and Switzerland barely pay any interest while US money market funds are around 4%. People are basically disgusted with their bank accounts which is why corporate bonds exist.\n\nHis proposal involves structuring accounts with about 80% digital credit instruments, 20% regular currency, and an extra 10% buffer to reduce volatility. The digital credit layer would be backed by Bitcoin reserves with about 5 to 1 overcollateralization. Basically using Bitcoin as the ultimate collateral layer.\n\nSaylor thinks a country that implements this could attract $20 to $50 trillion in deposits and become the digital banking capital of the world. Thats not a small claim.\n\nHowever theres obvious skepticism here. Bitcoin is down 28% from its recent highs and dropped 9% over the past year. The volatility makes people question how you can build stable high yield products on top of it. One former bond trader called Saylors moves folly and said hiking rates to maintain a peg wont work when people want their money back during a panic.\n\nStrategy already has a product called STRC that works somewhat like this - its grown to $2.9 billion but faces doubts about whether it can handle a real liquidity crunch.\n\nThe idea is innovative but feels like it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating long term to actually work. What happens during extended bear markets?",

It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government, which has blocked imports of less powerful chips, such as Nvidia’s H20.\n\nThe move, which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, could bolster Nvidia’s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide.\n    \n[Source](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/08/2025/commerce-to-open-up-exports-of-nvidia-h200-chips-to-china)",

With the missing October data, and the compromised November data, I actually think they might opt to hold rates steady until they have a more complete data set in January. From their point of view there is no harm in waiting; one month won't make a big difference in the long term. Looking at the most recent reports, the data doesnt seem to support the notion that inflation is coming down or that joblessness is much worse than it was earlier this year--look at the charts. I'm sure a lot of you want to tell me that the job market is trash, and I agree, but it's not in the data. And we definitely can't be certain that tariffs are gone for good. I'm preparing for a bloodbath this Wednesday, maybe even the beginning of the AI crash. ",

My allocation is 70/20/10 which feels right but the mental clarity from simplifying was honestly the best part, I don't spend hours reading earnings or arguing online anymore, I check everything with blossom now and my returns have been totally fine, just buying more shares monthly and ignoring the noise, nothing crazy but steady…\n\nIf you're on the fence about going full bogle I'd say just do it, the peace of mind is worth more than chasing extra returns",

But the key question is **what happens next year**.\n\nPowell's term ends in May next year, and Trump has already picked his successor (likely Kevin Hassett, White House National Economic Council Director, super dovish). Market rumors say it could be announced before Christmas.\n\n**Two variables for next year:**\n\n1. **New chair will be more dovish** \\- Hassett wrote \"Dow 36,000,\" advocates for quick rate cuts and tax cuts, absolutely bullish for stocks. 1-2 cuts next year should be solid.\n2. **Tariff situation is settled** \\- Trump's tariff policy is basically done negotiating, deals are signed, exemptions granted. Although some furniture and lumber tariffs will increase next year, overall it won't spike like it did in April. Supreme Court is reviewing tariff legality, but even if overturned, Trump has other legal tools available, minimal impact.\n\n**What about tomorrow?**\n\nFutures are already up 0.4%, likely opening with a small gain of 0.2-0.5%. Real direction depends on Powell's 2:30 PM press conference. If he's optimistic about next year, Nasdaq pushes to 23,700-24,000. If he's still worried about inflation, might pullback to 23,300.\n\n**What about 2026?**\n\nWall Street predicts Nasdaq up 15-25% next year, targeting 27,000-30,000. Logic: AI continues burning cash, tech earnings grow 15-20%, new chair more dovish, tariffs won't get worse.\n\nBottom line - next year's hand is actually pretty good. Powell's out, someone who loves cutting rates comes in; tariff war's over, no more chaos. Nasdaq's up 22% this year, another run next year isn't impossible.",

While this opens the door for renewed sales, there’s still uncertainty around how strong demand will be.

The decision partially rolls back restrictions that had previously barred shipments of Nvidia’s A100, H100, and H200-class GPUs to Chinese customers over national security concerns.\n\nUnder the revised rules, Nvidia may resume sales of the H200 so long as exported configurations fall within newly defined performance limits and comply with enhanced government monitoring. The adjustment follows weeks of uncertainty, during which Nvidia executives repeatedly emphasized that final export approval would ultimately come from President Trump.\n\nChina represents 20 to 25% of Nvidia’s data-center revenue. Restoring access even partially could meaningfully lift 2026 sales guidance.",

      "content": "The 5 \"North Star\" Principles I Return to When the Market Gets Manic (Graham &amp; Munger Refresher)\n\nI’ve been reading a lot of complex DCF models and technical debates on the sub recently. While the math is obviously critical, I think it’s easy to get lost in the weeds and forget the philosophical bedrock that makes Value Investing work in the first place.\n\nI recently went back through Graham’s *The Intelligent Investor* and *Charlie Munger’s Almanack* to organize my own thinking. I wanted to share the 5 core principles that I treat as non-negotiable, especially when the market feels irrational.\n\n**1. Price vs. Value (The Behavioral Trap)** *\"Price is what you pay; value is what you get.\"* This is the hardest psychological hurdle. We are biologically wired to view a rising price as validation and a falling price as failure. Value investing requires decoupling these two. I try to view \"Mr. Market\" as a tool to be used, not a guide to be followed. If he offers a discount, I buy. If he’s manic, I ignore him.\n\n**2. The Margin of Safety (The Engineering)** Graham’s \"Rule #1.\" It’s basically engineering redundancy for your portfolio. If you buy a dollar for 50 cents, you can be wrong about the growth rate, management, or macro headwinds and *still* not lose money. It’s not just about maximizing upside; it’s about pre-calculating the downside so you survive the mistake.\n\n**3. Quality over \"Cigar Butts\" (The Pivot)** Early Graham focused on \"cigar butts\" (dying companies that were cheap). Buffett and Munger evolved this. It is far better to buy a *wonderful* company at a fair price than a *fair* company at a wonderful price. Time is the friend of the wonderful business and the enemy of the mediocre one.\n\n**4. The \"Latticework\" (The Edge)** Investing isn't just finance. Munger’s concept of the \"Latticework of Mental Models\" suggests that if you only know accounting, you’ll fail. You need to understand psychology (biases), history (cycles), and probability. The best investors are \"learning machines\" first and analysts second.\n\n**5. Temperament &gt; Intellect** You can have a 160 IQ and go broke if you can't control your emotions. The ability to do nothing for 2 years while holding cash, or to buy when the headlines are apocalyptic, is a temperament skill, not an IQ skill.\n\n**My Takeaway:** Whenever I make a mistake, it’s usually because I violated #2 (paid too much) or #5 (got impatient).\n\n*I wrote a longer breakdown with some visual aids and the full quote collection here if you want to bookmark it:*[https://humblepics.com/what-is-value-investing/](https://humblepics.com/what-is-value-investing/)",

      "content": "China should say, \"no thank you to further Nvidia imports\", and develop its own domestic chip industry\n\nAccording to The Gaurdian:\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.\n\nAccording to fool49:\n\nBut what is great for China? And what is great for the world? To end the dependence on USA and Nvidia for GPUs. And make long term contracts for supply of AI chips from diverse sources, including Google TPUs, and Chinese AI chips. Chinese will eventually catch up with USA in AI chips. Huawei, Baidu, and Cambricorn are the local suppliers. Private Chinese companies are still reliant on Nvidia, but with the right government policies, that will be over by 2030. \n\nAnd India needs startup and big tech funding to develop its own AI chip design and manufacturing industry. With support from the government and domestic and international venture capital, they should have AI independence within a decade.\n\nReference: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/08/trump-nvidia-ai-chips-china",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-09 07:32:07  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral to Cautiously Bullish**  \n- **Reddit sentiment** is mixed but leans optimistic, with high-scoring posts on Nvidia chip sales to China, a large Netflix purchase, and a \"30K SPY YOLO\" indicating retail bullishness on equities. However, posts like \"Economy is dragging, but the stock market is thriving. Why?\" reflect underlying confusion and potential divergence concerns.  \n- **RSS News** highlights a wavering S&P 500 as traders await Fed guidance and Oracle earnings, suggesting short-term indecision.  \n- **Macro Data** shows a moderate equity risk premium (4.33%), stable VIX (16.66), and steady unemployment (4.4%), supporting a neutral risk environment.  \n- **Conclusion:** Sentiment is bifurcated—retail optimism contrasts with institutional caution ahead of key catalysts.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES:  \n**a) Geopolitical/Tech Trade Policy:**  \n- Dominant theme across Reddit and news: U.S. allowing Nvidia H200 chip sales to China (multiple high-scoring Reddit posts, Yahoo Finance analysis). This signals a potential de-escalation in tech trade restrictions under the Trump administration.  \n\n**b) Market Divergence Concerns:**  \n- Reddit post #4 questions the disconnect between a \"dragging\" economy and a \"thriving\" stock market—echoing broader macro uncertainty.  \n\n**c) Earnings & Event-Driven Speculation:**  \n- Reddit posts highlight \"Happy Earnings Day!\" and large Netflix ($NFLX) purchases, while news notes traders sidelined ahead of Oracle earnings and Fed signals.  \n\n**d) Sector-Specific Developments:**  \n- **Autos:** Ford/GM outperforming; Tesla facing Europe headwinds.  \n- **Streaming:** Netflix vs. AMC theaters narrative emerging.  \n- **Crypto:** Significant ETF outflows ($5B) and Bitcoin-related stock volatility.  \n\n**e) Retail Nostalgia/Meme Activity:**  \n- GameStop and \"apes\" references persist, indicating lingering meme-stock interest.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS:  \n**Immediate Catalysts (Next 1-2 Days):**  \n- **Fed Policy Signals:** Traders on sidelines (per Bloomberg) awaiting clarity on rates.  \n- **Oracle Earnings:** Could set tone for tech sector.  \n- **PPI Data Delay:** October report delayed to mid-January (Reddit #14)—may reduce near-term inflation volatility.  \n\n**Structural Signals:**  \n- **Nvidia Chip Sales to China:** Positive for NVDA and semiconductor supply chain; reduces geopolitical overhang.  \n- **Crypto Liquidity Drain:** $5B ETF exodus (Bloomberg) signals cooling retail crypto demand—potential risk for crypto-correlated assets.  \n- **Auto Sector Divergence:** Traditional automakers (F, GM) outperforming vs. Tesla struggles in Europe.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT:  \n**Risks:**  \n1. **Event Risk:** Fed messaging could spark volatility if hawkish.  \n2. **Liquidity Risk:** Crypto ETF outflows may spill over into speculative tech stocks.  \n3. **Geopolitical Uncertainty:** While chip sales are a positive step, U.S.-China tensions remain fluid.  \n4. **Valuation Risk:** Market thriving despite economic drag raises sustainability questions.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Semiconductor Sector:** Nvidia news could lift AI/chip stocks (NVDA, SMH, SOXX).  \n2. **Defensive Dividends:** Interest in S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (Yahoo Finance) suggests rotation into quality.  \n3. **Auto Value Play:** Ford/GM momentum may continue if Tesla weakness persists.  \n4. **Volatility Suppression:** Low VIX and delayed PPI report may support short-term rally.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:  \n**SYMBOL: NVDA** – Monitor for breakout above $185 on high volume; chip-sales news is a fundamental catalyst, but beware of \"sell the news\" reaction given recent slight decline (-0.47%).  \n**SECTOR: Semiconductors** – Beneficiary of eased China trade restrictions; consider SMH or SOXX ETFs for diversified exposure.  \n**SYMBOL: ORCL** – Earnings today could move cloud/AI sector; implied volatility likely elevated.  \n**SECTOR: Automotive** – F and GM showing relative strength; avoid TSLA until Europe concerns clear.  \n**SYMBOL: SPY** – Retail bullishness (30K YOLO) contrasts with institutional caution; wait for Fed clarity before adding positions.  \n**ASSET: Crypto** – Avoid new allocations until ETF outflows stabilize; Bitcoin-related stocks (e.g., Twenty One) under pressure.  \n**THEMATIC: Dividend Aristocrats** – Defensive rotation play amid economic uncertainty; consider ETFs like NOBL.  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** The market is in a holding pattern ahead of Fed and earnings catalysts, with retail optimism buoyed by geopolitical tech news. Focus on semiconductor and auto opportunities, but maintain caution on crypto and high-valuation tech. Await Fed guidance for broader direction.",

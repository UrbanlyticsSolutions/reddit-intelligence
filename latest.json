      "content": "U.S. crude oil drops below $55 a barrel, hits lowest level since early 2021\n\nOil has been under steady pressure this year, and it doesn’t seem to be coming from just one factor. OPEC+ has been adding supply back into the market faster than many expected after years of disciplined output cuts, and that extra production is starting to show up in inventories and price action. At the same time, the geopolitical risk premium that supported crude over the past couple of years is slowly deflating. Markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, or at least a less volatile outlook, which reduces fears around supply disruptions tied to the conflict.\nPut together, it’s a tough setup for oil bulls: more barrels coming online while the “fear bid” fades. Demand hasn’t collapsed, but it hasn’t been strong enough to absorb the new supply without pressure on prices. Curious how others are thinking about this is this just a cyclical oversupply phase, or does it mark a longer period of capped oil prices if geopolitics cool and OPEC+ prioritizes volume over price?\n\n Source :\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/crude-oil-prices-today.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "content": "Why Dr. Burry can’t talk about swaps, FTDs, or “the plumbing”  and why that silence actually matters\n\n1. What Burry didn’t say (and why people noticed) A lot of people reacted to Burry’s post by saying:\n\nHe didn’t mention swaps\n\nHe didn’t mention FTDs\n\nHe didn’t talk about the buy button\n\nHe didn’t reference the $80+ run with RK’s disclosed position\n\nHe didn’t disclose his current position\n\nAt face value, that looks STRANGE, especially if you’ve been following GME CLOSELY. But this assumes Burry is just another Twitter commentator.\n\nHe’s not.\n\n2. There’s a hard legal line between “opinion” and “allegation”\n\nTalking about:\n\nvaluation\n\nbalance sheets\n\ncapital allocation\n\npatience\n\nincentives\n\n\\-&gt; legal, protected financial opinion\n\nTalking about:\n\npersistent FTDs implying non-delivery\n\nswaps being used to hide short exposure\n\nprice suppression through settlement mechanics\n\nbrokers/clearing houses failing to deliver shares\n\n\\-&gt;implicit allegations of market manipulation or settlement failure\n\nThat’s not commentary. That’s accusation.\n\nOnce a hedge fund manager publicly connects:\n\nspecific stock + settlement failures + identifiable MECHANISMS they expose themselves to:\n\nSEC inquiries\n\nsubpoenas\n\ndiscovery\n\naccusations of market signaling or manipulation\n\nBurry already lived through this once after 2008. He knows exactly where that line is.\n\n3. Why FTDs are especially radioactive\n\nReported short interest:\n\nis self-reported\n\nnetted\n\ndelayed\n\nlegally sanitized\n\nFTDs are different:\n\nthey are hard settlement failures\n\nthey show up after the trade\n\nthey imply that someone sold something they didn’t deliver on time\n\nPublicly tying persistent FTDs to price behavior is essentially saying: “Someone cannot or will not deliver shares they sold.”\n\nThat’s not something a regulated fund manager can casually TWEET. Retail can talk about it. Analysts can speculate. Dr. Burry cannot.\n\n4. Why he talks about time instead of price\n\nIf Burry believed, “this resolves via a quick squeeze”  he’d say nothing.\n\nIf Burry believed, “this is immediate fraud” he’d stay silent.\n\nInstead, he emphasized:\n\npatience\n\noptionality\n\ncapital discipline\n\nbalance sheet strength\n\nThat framing only makes sense if:\n\npressure exists\n\nit is being actively managed\n\nresolution depends on time, not a single event\n\nFTDs, swaps, and synthetic exposure are time-based problems. They don’t explode instantly, they compound.\n\nThat’s the subtext.\n\n5. Why GameStop’s cash position matters more than people think (not apes 😁)\n\nHolding cash is often mocked as “doing nothing.”\n\nIn reality:\n\ncash removes bankruptcy risk\n\ncash denies shorts their best exit\n\ncash preserves optionality\n\nIf you believe there is structural short exposure, then: Not deploying capital prematurely is rational.\n\nWhy pull the trigger on the only hostage you have left?\n\nBurry highlighting patience isn’t passive, it’s strategic.\n\n6. Silence ≠ ignorance\n\nThe idea that Dr. Michael Burry an seasoned investor capable of getting large investment banks to write him custom TRS contracts​, understands swaps, understands FTDs, understands incentives …but somehow “forgot” to mention them publicly …is far less believable than the idea that he can’t mention them.\n\nHis post isn’t for retail hype, It’s for people who already understand how this works.\n\n7. The tell: what everyone avoids saying out loud\n\nNotice who else never speaks directly about:\n\nnaked shorts\n\nswaps\n\nFTDs\n\nRyan Cohen. Roaring Kitty. Michael Burry.\n\nDifferent people. Same silence.\n\nThat’s not coincidence. That’s legal reality.\n\nConclusion\n\nBurry’s post wasn’t incomplete, it was bounded. He said what he legally could:\n\npatience\n\ncapital structure\n\ntime\n\nEverything else swaps, FTDs, settlement stress is left for readers to infer. In markets like this, what isn’t said matters more than what is. And silence, in this case, isn’t weakness.\n\nIt’s self-preservation.\n\nTL;DR Michael Burry didn’t “miss” swaps, FTDs, or market structure issues in his recent comments on GameStop. He can’t talk about them without inviting a legal and regulatory nightmare. What he did say about patience, capital structure, and time is the maximum signal he can legally send.\n\nLooking forward to part2 💎👐\n\nNote this is not a Burry fluff piece I'm just sharing my humble thoughts on what I think this implies. I love the fact that the big short OG is talking about my Favorite company after all these years. The saga continues.\n\n  \nThanks to... banana-in-my-anus for the contribution 😀",

      "title": "The November ADP Jobs report is worse than you think, and a sign of what's to come",
      "content": "The November ADP Jobs report is worse than you think, and a sign of what's to come\n\nPlenty of articles have came out reporting on the 32,000 reduction in US private employment that ADP reported. This seems bad, but the reality is far worse.\n\nIf you look at the employment changes by employer size, employers with less than 50 workers employ 120,000 less in November, whereas employers with &gt;=50 workers 90,000 more, nearly cancelling out the losses from smaller employers.\n\nThe reason this is notable is because smaller employers are faster to respond to changes in business conditions than larger ones, for a number of reasons:\n\n- Large businesses are generally more bureaucratic and involve annual budgets, so it can take time for layoffs to occur in response to slowing demand, whereas a small business with &lt;50 employees don't have a long chain of management that makes layoffs a long process.\n\n- Large businesses are required to issue advance notice of mass layoffs via WARN. Businesses with &lt;100 employees are exempt. This further delays large businesses seeking to downsize even after they finalize a plan.\n\n- Small businesses have less access to capital and higher borrowing costs to be able to ride out short to mid term impacts to cash flow, making layoffs necessary to manage cash flows when revenue falls. Larger companies have access to revolving credit facilities at low interest rates which addresses short term cash flows challenges.\n\nAs a result of all this, small businesses are actually a really strong leading indicator of where the labor market will go. Large businesses, while slower to react to business conditions, are historically even more cyclical than small businesses. So we are likely to see a reduction in employment at mid to large private sector firms in the near future.\n\nPosition: Lots of VGLT to bet on rate cuts and QE pushing up bond prices/yields down. Might be premature(I have no idea what numbers will show tomorrow), but I think the labor market is going to slow further in the coming year.",

Arbitrum has $10B+ TVL and processes billions in transactions. Celestia's modular blockchain thesis is still valid. But guess what? The **token price keeps bleeding** because of massive VC unlock schedules.\n\n* ARB: \\~92M tokens unlock every month until March 2027\n* TIA: VCs dumping until October 2026-2027\n\nYou're fighting against billions of dollars of institutional selling pressure while holding the bag.\n\n**2. Memecoins are pure gambling**\n\nI bought WIF and BONK, thinking \"meme season\" would return. It didn't. Old memes rarely recapture their glory.\n\n**3. Dead narratives stay dead**\n\nSUSHI is a relic from 2020. Uniswap won. VANRY is too small to compete with Solana/Base.\n\n**4. Opportunity cost is real**\n\nWhile I diamond-handed these bags, I could've been in BTC, ETH, or SOL — coins that actually recovered.\n\n# My dilemma\n\nWith only \\~$167 left:\n\n* **Option A:** Sell everything, harvest tax losses, wait for better entries\n* **Option B:** Consolidate into 1-2 conviction plays (maybe keep ARB/S and dump the rest)\n* **Option C:** Diamond hands and pray for 2027 when unlocks end\n\n# What would you do?\n\nI'm genuinely looking for honest opinions, not hopium. If you've been in a similar situation, what did you decide?\n\n*Not looking for \"should've bought BTC\" comments, I know. Looking for actionable advice on what to do NOW with what I have.*",

Might as well do it here and try and help someone from making my mistakes.\n\nSo, I have a story as to why you never use margin. I suggest you read if you feel invincible and want to up your gains.\n\nAs of October 10, I was up 220% for the year with a portfolio size of 240k.\n\nAs of today, I am up 10% for the year and have a portfolio size of 84k.\n\nWhat changed? Margin.\n\nIt started with slow, steady gains. I owned SOXL, GOOG, UNH, CNC, and I bought them all at lows in April. I made a killing, obviously. Lots of options got me there.\n\nI was on top of the world, invincible, could quit my job and become a trader. So, I sized up my positions and tapped into margin.\n\nDay 1: Lost 15k. Day 2: 10k more. Day 3: 12k more.\n\nSo I swapped some positions around, went heavier on 3 positions and sold my diversification.\n\nMargined in more on \"the dips\", this is in the AI Space. DGXX, IREN, CIFR.\n\nFast-forward 2 months and -100k later, I have finally sold the rest of my Leverage and withdrawn the last from my margin account. Now, mainly back to just my retirement and tax-free accounts.\n\nI also lost a family member 25k with my investing tips.\n\nI guess I just want everyone to remember to stay humble. I have definitely learned a few lessons. Trying to sleep at night now with all the red flashes in my head. Hope this helps some of you from making my mistakes.\n\nIts funny because I know better. I did this in 2020 and took a 4 year break. Finally though I was ready agian, and I made a killing!!!\n\nNow I need to face my mistakes.\n\nEdit: for those of you who provided good advice and wisdom. Thank you 1000%. For those who harped on me. Also thank you. I need this pain to stick so I can forever be a better investor. ",

At this point, it’s the only player running large-scale, fully driverless commercial services in multiple cities, which gives it a meaningful real-world data advantage. Amazon’s Zoox is taking a different approach, starting with limited public access. It’s begun offering free driverless rides around parts of the Las Vegas Strip and select San Francisco neighborhoods, signaling confidence in its tech but still moving cautiously. Tesla has entered the conversation with a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the Bay Area, but as of mid-December those vehicles still rely on human drivers or safety supervisors. That puts Tesla more in a pilot phase than true autonomy for now.\nOverall, the gap between “driverless demos” and fully autonomous, scaled operations is becoming clearer. Waymo looks firmly in front today, while Zoox and Tesla are progressing just on very different timelines and risk profiles.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/waymo-amazon-zoox-tesla-robotaxi-expansion.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

This bodes well for adult toys. \n\nThe company has had lots of challenges, which have driven their poor performance. But it is my belief that most of their problems stem from macro issues. Hogs are very discretionary products. Naturally, the 180 turn from the ZIRP stay-at-home stimmy check environment to the current rock-bottom consumer sentiment has hurt the company. \n\nNevertheless, the new CEO has taken solid steps into fixing some of their intrinsic issues like strengthening ties with dealerships and derisiking their financing division. \n\nThe stock is cheap. The company trades below its net assets while having valuable intangibles such as their financing business and (of course) their brand. My valuation of the business is $33 per share, that implies 50% upside. \n\nThis is a valuation pitch. I do not see a catalyst beyond q/q reports. If it takes three years for the company to reach fair value, the expected return is a 15% IRR, well above historical market returns.\n\nHowever, I do see a scenario where I own this stock for the long run.

      "content": "This famed short-seller explains why he’s doubling down on his bet against data centers - MarketWatch\n\n(Please note the flair. Basics/Getting Started)\n\nThis famed short-seller explains why he’s doubling down on his bet against data centers\n\nJim Chanos says the money will come from what the chips produce, not where they reside\n\nBy Barbara Kollmeyer\n\nInvestors continue to push doubts to the surface over AI bets paying off into year-end.\n\n \nAmong those with strong views on that theme is prominent investment manager Jim Chanos, best known for past short selling bets on Enron and Tesla. In a podcast interview with Monetary Matters with Jack Farley, Chanos discussed why he thinks dot-com bust 2.0 could be coming as he explained one bearish bet he’s doubling down on.\n \n\nThe investor placed a big short bet on legacy data centers in 2022, describing the old cloud data center business as “crummy,” with a “very low return on capital business, highly capital intensive.”\n \n\nChanos said he’s even less convinced on the newest version of data centers — those that host GPUs, or rent out computing power to AI companies. “It’s basically a commodity business, particularly as everybody’s building them. And our view to clients has been the magic and the money is going to come from what the chips produce ultimately, not where they reside,” he said.\n\n \nInvestors wanting to make AI bets should stick to pure AI titans like OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, or hyperscalers, he said. “But investing in bitcoin miners that are converting to data center companies or me-too companies that are jumping on the so-called neoclouds, which are basically just landlords, to me seems problematic for two reasons,” he said.\n\n\n**Chanos mentioned CoreWeave CRWV by name while bitcoin miners-turned-data-center companies include Iren IREN and Cipher Mining CIFR.**\n \n\nThe first is that hosting GPUs is a low -margin, low-return on capital business, and the second is any data center buying the GPUs themselves must be making a bet on depreciation, he said. Chanos’ own estimate is that those GPUs could end up obsolete or not fast enough for clients within five years. Hedge fund founder Harris Kupperman and “Big Short” investor Michael Burry have also delivered strong warnings on GPU depreciation.\n \n\n**Chanos said that among the big hyperscalers building out their data centers — such as Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Oracle ORCL and Amazon AMZN — the first two will be able to finance that from their cash flows, but the rest “will need external financing.”**\n \n\nThe overriding AI bet is the technology will hit an inflection point in 2027 or 2028 and profits will flow. Oracle and Amazon have shown an inability thus far to monetize those big investments in AI, equipment, hardware and locations, and that’s one reason he’s short on Oracle.\n \n\n \n\nHe added that many big hyperscalers want to get the data-center business off their own balance sheets and just lease from someone else. “The bet is you’re buying these things and leasing them out and that five or six years is actually too conservative, you’ll be able to earn money on them for 10 or 12 years,” he said.\n \n\nChanos said the data-center world is going to shrink as just a handful will be needed and makes the scenario look “a lot like 1999 and 2000.”\n \n\nHe warns that a credit crunch or pullback in sentiment such as seen the early 2000s would see a lot of that spending by those companies drop fairly fast. “The risk levels for all these companies are much higher than they were five or 10 years ago,” he said.\n\nFIN\n\n\nThe pod cast article is here\n\nhttps://trkmw.dowjones.com/click/43066481.216328/aHR0cHM6Ly9wb2RjYXN0cy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvcG9kY2FzdC90aGUtYWktZGF0YS1jZW50ZXItc2hvcnQtamltLWNoYW5vcy1vbi1vcmFjbGUtZGF0YS9pZDE3NjkwOTM5MDY_aT0xMDAwNzQxMzk3NTc0Jm1vZD1kamVtX213bm5lZWR0b2tub3c/6776e8dd2719be24a983dc02Bc8498078\n\n\n———\n\n*My comment:*\n\nCharlie Munger said that the biggest mistake a person can make is not learning from others and only want to learn from their own mistakes, because this time it is different.\n\nMichael Burry and Jim Chanos might be early but they are not usually wrong. Mock them at your own peril. \n\n",

Which one would you recommend for a simple LLC setup? How was their customer service if you had questions?\n\nAlso, about how much did you end up paying total with all the fees? I see the advertised price but i read there are always extra fees and stuff. Any helpful info would be apprecaited!",

      "content": "Not Every Small Biotech Is Pre-Revenue, This One Already Sells Product\n\nThere is a reflex reaction in small-cap trading where people hear the word biotech and immediately assume no revenue and constant dilution. That shortcut breaks down when you actually look at SBFM.\n\nSunshine Biopharma currently carries a market cap around 6M, yet recent numbers point to more than 37M in annual revenue based on reported quarterly results and product sales. That alone separates it from the majority of Nasdaq biotechs in this range, many of which generate no commercial revenue at all.\n\nThis revenue is coming from approved generic drugs sold through its Canadian subsidiary, not from speculative trial assets. The company has been expanding its product lineup, which suggests ongoing execution rather than a stalled pipeline. That does not remove risk, but it changes the conversation.\n\nWhen a stock trades as if the business does not exist, even basic awareness can shift sentiment. In low-float names, that shift does not require perfect fundamentals, only consistency and visibility.\n\nDo your own research.",

      "content": "Three Health Canada Approvals In A Row And The Market Still Treats It Like Nothing Changed\n\nWhat stands out here is not one headline. It is repetition.\n\n\n\nOver the last stretch, Sunshine Biopharma has cleared three separate Health Canada approvals through its Canadian subsidiary. Domperidone was approved, followed by doxycycline, and then Pravastatin. For a microcap pharma, clearing even one approval can take years. Clearing three in sequence points to a system that works, not a lucky break.\n\n\n\nEach of these products is a standard prescription generic with established demand. That matters because approvals translate directly into sellable inventory and recurring revenue, not distant milestones. This builds on an existing base where the company is already generating more than 37M in annual revenue per recent filings, while the entire market cap sits around 6 to 7M.\n\n\n\nDespite that, SBFM still trades near the 1 dollar range. That pricing suggests the market is either ignoring the approvals or assuming they do not matter financially. Historically, chains of approvals tend to matter more than isolated wins because they signal execution.\n\n\n\nDo your own research.\n\n",

      "title": "It's Target's Time to Run (TGT)",
      "content": "It's Target's Time to Run (TGT)\n\nI invested in Target back in May at a price around 97.50, and I think it has momentum to make a really nice run in the beginning of 2026. I'm going to give the bear case first, then my case. I'm not using any AI, so I apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\n  \nThe Bear Case:\n\n1. **Bleeding customers/sales:** This is not good, and this is the biggest reason why the stock is down more than 60% from its high. Through the end of Q3, net sales are down 1.7% YOY. Traffic is down 2.2%. As a result, Target lowered their full-year EPS forecast from $7-$9 down to $7-$8. That means they're expecting to be less profitable than last year, when they earned $8.86 per share. There are other headwinds, but this is by far the biggest and most serious one. \n2. **Broader Economic Uncertainty**: Notice how the tech stocks have driven the gains in the market recently? That's because for the regular people, things aren't great. And if things aren't great for the regular people, then they don't shop at Target\n3. **DEI pushback:** This one hasn't been in the news as much recently, but there is still the occasional buzz about how Target rolled back its DEI policies and apparently kowtowed to Trump. I don't think this is a huge deal anymore, but it's still out there.\n4. **Walmart is eating Target's lunch:** There have been lots of articles recently like [this one](https://qz.com/walmart-prices-affluent-shoppers) talking about the progress Walmart has made with wealthier shoppers. Heck, my parents are in this group. My mom used to hate shopping at Walmart, but she's getting deliveries every week with Walmart+. Walmart stores have more cutesy displays and are generally less trashy than they were 5 years ago. When Walmart takes market share like this, guess who loses? Target\n5. **Corporate Layoffs:** Target also laid off 1000 corporate employees and is closing another 800 open positions, their biggest reduction in at least a decade. I don't hate this move, but it certainly didn't happen because times are good in Minneapolis.\n\nSo, why in the world am I still in Target? Here's why:\n\n1. **Hefty (and safe) dividend**: The dividend yield is currently at 4.7%, and they're due to hike it in a few quarters. Even if the turnaround takes some time, that drip will accumulate pretty quickly. The payout ratio is under 70%, so even with the current drop in sales, it'll take a while for that to really be in danger.\n2. **Share buybacks:** Target has $8.3 billion in share buybacks still authorized, and they've been buying. That's significant, especially at these bargain bin prices. So far, it seems like they've executed those perfectly.\n3. **New CEO:** The current COO, Brian Fiddelke, will take the reigns as the next Target CEO next year. He was the one who engineered the layoffs, showing that he's ready to make moves. Expectations for him literally couldn't be lower: When he was announced during Q2 earnings, the stock quickly dropped 15% to new 52-week lows. That's a lot of negative sentiment, and should be relatively easy to overcome. \n4. **Realistic turnaround plan:** So, what does Fiddelke want to do to save the company? Exactly what he should: Better, trendier merchandise; cleaner, shinier stores; and better tech and supply chain management. Ta-daa! That's exactly what they need to do, and it's already been paying off. As a personal anecdote, the Target nearest me was pretty dumpy a few months ago, with big, chaotic sale racks and disorganized everything. I went last weekend and it was 10 times cleaner, with more staff, better displays, and more customers. That place was packed and still looked good. But what's even more relevant is Target's numbers have actually improved since the disastrous Q1 earnings. Digital sales are up significantly, and total sales, earnings, and traffic declines have slowed. This ship *is* turning around, albeit slowly.\n5. **Cyclical rotations will benefit Target:** Eventually, the economy will turn around for the middle-class, which is the vast majority of Target's customers. Whether that happens in 2026 or not, it'll happen eventually. Also, we're in the middle of a huge rotation out of tech. The Dow is up, and the Nasdaq is down. Guess who's benefited from that? Target. The stock is up almost 20% from it's 5-year low almost a month ago, and it has plenty of room to run. The more AI falls, the more safer stocks like Target benefit.\n6. **Limited downside:** Unless Target's earnings fall off a cliff next year, that dividend is safe. With that, there's a pretty firm bottom to how low the stock can go. If things continue to go badly, it could drop to 75-80, but at some point that fat yield would keep it from dropping more.\n\nSo here are all the catalysts that could lead to a bumper Q1 earnings call: New CEO optimism, corporate cost-cutting paying off, continued share buybacks, an expected hike to an already hefty dividend, cyclical rotations out of tech, a turnaround plan that's actually working, and continued digital growth. They're also still profitable, and still opening new stores. Of course, this isn't a risk-free play: Tariff costs are still up in the air and could deal a big blow in Q4 not just to Target, but to the whole retail sector as they eat the costs to keep market share. And if the economy continues to suffer, so will Target. But, if Target shows any signs of life, this thing will shoot up pretty quickly. I think Q1 earnings could be that catalyst:  Q1 was truly dreadful in 2025, and if they can beat those numbers in 2026 even modestly, it'll be some serious momentum for the stock with a new CEO at the helm.\n\n  \nTLDR: New CEO, cyclical rotations out of tech, crazy low expectations, and a turnaround plan that's actually working will send Target up 30% after Q1 earnings in 2026.",

The company owns two buildings in Roanoke, Indiana, with its 189,000 sq ft headquarters currently listed for a $29.5 million sale-leaseback at an 8.5% cap rate, and a 430,000 sq ft distribution center worth an estimated $15 to $20 million. Downside is further anchored by $82.9 million of inventory (down from $109.6 million YoY) plus $19 million in receivables, and the balance sheet sits at roughly breakeven with $10.7 million in cash versus $10.0 million drawn on its ABL facility.\n\nFund 1 Investments, owning 10% of shares with 20% economic exposure, filed a 13D in January 2025 agitating for a strategic review or sale, while new leadership under Executive Chairman Ian Bickley (ex-Coach) has launched his turnaround plan called \"Project Sunshine,\" delivered five consecutive months of positive comparable Brand channel sales, and hired a Chief Brand Officer from Tapestry's Coach division.\n\nEven without a turnaround, a sale of the headquarters alone would generate proceeds equal to roughly 50% of the current market cap, while a return to modest profitability (mid-single-digit EBIT margins on $250 million revenue) would imply $0.35 to $0.45 in EPS, which gives the stock at least 2x upside from here.\n\nA couple of directors also just bought a combined $600k of the stock, which is over 1% of the company, and the largest purchases ever for these insiders.\n\nClark Square Capital pitched the stock ([link](https://www.joinyellowbrick.com/sp/124984)) at the end of October (and is still bullish), and AstutexAI pitched it as a long in mid-November ([link](https://www.joinyellowbrick.com/sp/125721)). *Note: I'm not affiliated with either of them.*",

First, it is unclear how big the cuts are and which part of Reality Labs they affect. Will it just be VR and the Metaverse, or will augmented reality (smart glasses) be included? Reports are of 10% and 30% cuts. Again, how will this be spread out?\n\nIf we assume it is 30% of the entirety of Reality Labs, which I don’t believe. With expenses of \\~$16 billion, that would be over $4 billion in cuts. But remember, Meta is expected to have expenses in the range of $116-$118 billion in 2025, which will accelerate in 2026. $4 billion is not all that significant compared to the massive spend on AI.\n\nThis metaverse cut is not that big of a deal. What is important is what it tells us about the AI spend and Metas’ willingness to cut it back if needed. Therefore, I see two likely outcomes for Meta. One, Mark Zuckerberg will reduce spend in the face of weak demand for AI, or two, AI will be a success and the high spend will continue.\n\nDoing a discounted cash flow valuation on both cases, I find Meta to be good value in either scenario. I get a weighted valuation of $950.\n\nImage: Reality Labs Revenue And Expenses\n\nI wasn't able to add images, you can search the same title for my Substack post to see them. Oh, I had to take out the reference links as Reddit was auto-blocking the post, I think.\n\n# Zuckerberg's Willingness To Change\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s willingness to change should not have come as a massive surprise. There are multiple examples throughout Zuckerberg's career where he has shown this flexibility.\n\nIn 2008, he embraced advertising, something he had long had doubts about, brought in Cheryl Sandberg, and gave up a lot of operational control when it was felt they needed an ‘Adult in the room’.\n\nAround 2010, Zuckerberg was all in on Facebook being a web-based platform without the need for a dedicated app. When that was proven wrong, they pivoted. Before long, they had one of the most popular apps in the world.\n\nAnd of course, more recently, they went all in on the metaverse, even changing the name of the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021. Then, in the 2022 Q4 report, they announced the ‘year of efficiency’. I see last week's reports of cuts in the metaverse as a continuation of this change of direction.\n\nIt is this history that gives me, and I believe some of the market, faith that Zuckerberg can change direction if it becomes clear that the massive AI spend is not generating the desired returns.\n\n# Two Scenarios\n\nTo help me value the company, I found it useful to think of two scenarios and do separate valuations for each of them. Scenario 1, AI returns do not appear, and cuts in CapEx are needed. Scenario 2, AI leads to increased revenue.\n\n**Scenario 1: Cuts to AI spend**\n\nMeta has been quite clear that AI has given tangible benefits to their underlying business. Most analysts expect over 15% growth in the next 12 months. In this scenario, I'm going to assume it ends there. Algorithms are as optimised as they can get, there are no more efficiencies to find, and no new AI revenue sources appear.\n\nImage: DCF Model For Scenario 1: Reduced CapEx\n\nI am modelling revenue falling back to a still respectable 8%, which will then trail off to a terminal growth rate of 5%. This may seem high given a failed AI pivot, but keep in mind the underlying business is still dominant in the world of social media. Ad spend is still migrating to online, the world, especially outside the US, is getting richer, and there is no reason to think that Meta will not continue to grow for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs we discussed in his history, I believe Zuckerberg will pivot in the face of an AI failure and reduce Capex and spend. Barring any writedown, this will likely take a number of years as depreciation works its way through the books. I am modelling EBIT margin to rise from the current \\~40% to a terminal margin of 49%. And for the terminal reinvestment, I'm assuming a return on invested capital of 20%.\n\nImage: Final DCF Calculations\n\nPutting all these numbers together. I get a valuation of $861. So even in the scenario of a failed AI buildout, there is a case for Meta to be good value. With that said, it is easy to see the stock selling off in that situation, which could allow for an even more attractive entry.\n\n# Scenario 2: AI is moderately successful\n\nAI succeeding is such a general statement that it is very difficult to model. I will assume their revenues remain higher for longer as they continue to reap the rewards of AI, both in their core business and in any new business models that come from AI. I am modelling them to have 20% growth, trailing off to 15% in 4 years, and then trailing off to a terminal growth rate of 5.5%.\n\nImage: DCF Model For Scenario 2: AI Moderate Success\n\nTo support this growth, I am continuing the high CapEx spend, but with that said, I am assuming that the costs are front-loaded and relative to revenue, CapEx will actually fail. I am modelling this as EBIT margins remaining fairly steady, with a terminal rate of 37%. For the terminal reinvestment, I am assuming a return on invested capital of 15%.\n\nImage: Final DCF Calculations\n\nAdding all that up gets me to a valuation of $1,115. Of course, there is plenty of room in this 'AI moderate success' scenario for more upside. I see this as a conservative valuation.\n\n# Combining The Models\n\nWhen I do more than one valuation model, I like to get a weighted average between them, which means we have to give each scenario a likelihood.\n\nWhile I believe AI will be transformational, I'm not convinced Meta will be the one to build it. For that reason, I'm putting ‘reduced CapEx’ as the slightly more likely scenario and giving it a 65% weighting.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, if a company wants to be successful, it will need piles of money, abundant sources of data, and a willingness to go for it. Zuckerberg and Meta have all of that. I am putting a weighting of 35% on the ‘AI moderately successful’ scenario.\n\nImage: Weighted Average Calculation\n\nAI will succeed or fail. It is black or white, but I do like to work in the grey middle, so for my overall valuation, I will be using this weighted average of $950. \n\nGiven the different potential outcomes, it will be important to regularly update this model and my $950 valuation. For now, I am confident in placing a BUY target on the stock.\n\n# Risks\n\nZuckerberg has full control over Meta with his super-voting rights. And while in the past he's shown a willingness to change direction. A shareholder still has to accept that they are at the whims of one person. If he digs his heels in and says he will succeed in AI or take Meta down with him, there is not much we can do\n\nAs with any international company, there will be regulation and antitrust risk. From European Union fines to the Austrailian under 16 ban, there is a constant risk on this front.\n\nIf AI is as disruptive as many think it will be, there is no valuation model, no company, and perhaps no industry that is safe.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMeta giving up on the metaverse is not the real story here. The real story is that once again, Mark Zuckerberg has shown a willingness to change direction when needed. The market sees that willingness to change direction as a safety net. If AI succeeds, great, shareholders will reap the rewards. If it fails, Zuckerberg will cut his losses, rightsize the company, and continue to run the world's largest social media empire.\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my Substack for more valuations like this.\n\n",

      "content": "Tape Watching This Microcap As India News Becomes The Wildcard\n\nSometimes the setup is not about what has happened, but what could change the tape quickly.\n\nRIME trades with a relatively thin float, which makes volume spikes matter more than usual. When liquidity is limited, new attention or a single credible catalyst can move price faster than fundamentals alone would suggest. That is why the India angle keeps showing up on trader radars.\n\nAny confirmation tied to India, whether a pilot, partnership, or customer expansion, would not just be a fundamental update. It would be a visibility event. In small-cap names, visibility often drives the first move, analysis follows later.\n\nRight now, price action reflects hesitation and low engagement. That can persist, but it also means the stock is sensitive to changes in participation. Watching volume alongside news flow becomes more important than watching indicators in isolation.\n\nThe key question is simple: if the next meaningful update is India-related, does the market react slowly, or does it rush to reprice exposure all at once?\n\nDo your own research.",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORT**\n**Analysis Time:** 2025-12-16 12:21:05 | **Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: BEARISH WITH SPECULATIVE FRINGES**\nThe aggregate sentiment is **bearish**, driven by fundamental macro pressures and retail anxiety. However, pockets of speculative, high-risk retail activity persist.\n*   **Macro & Institutional Bearishness:** Plunging oil prices (<$55), a still-hawkish Fed narrative (Bostic's comments), and a rising unemployment rate (4.6%) point to concerns over demand destruction and economic slowing.\n*   **Retail Sentiment:** Reddit shows clear distress (e.g., \"*Trying to make it all back before end of yr. $100k in SPY put weeklies*\") and fixation on past meme narratives (GME/Burry). This indicates a reactive, fear/greed-driven retail base, not a source of stable bullish conviction. The repeated discussion of Nasdaq's 24/7 trading plans suggests retail is anticipating higher volatility and more opportunities for loss.\n*   **Contrarian Data Point:** The low VIX (16.5) is at odds with the bearish news flow, suggesting complacency or that near-term volatility risk is underpriced.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES**\n*   **Energy & Deflationary Shock:** **Oil's collapse** is the dominant theme (3 of top 15 Reddit posts, WTI sub-$55). This is a major deflationary signal and a negative for energy equities, but a potential cost relief for transports and consumers.\n*   **Monetary Policy & Economic Stress:** Fed officials highlighting inflation risk juxtaposed with rising unemployment (\"A Growing Population of Unemployed Americans\") creates a policy dilemma narrative. High-profile corporate distress (Carlyle's $100M loss, First Brands bankruptcy) reinforces the theme.\n*   **Corporate Strategy Pivots:** Major firms are making dramatic shifts (**Ford's** $19.5B EV charge/hybrid pivot, **Kraft Heinz** CEO change/pre-split). This signals sector-wide reassessment of capital allocation in a changing macro environment.\n*   **Market Structure Evolution:** The push for **24/7 trading** (Nasdaq) and \"Moving Money 24/7\" (Visa) is a recurring topic, indicating the financial industry is preparing for a less interrupted, potentially more volatile trading landscape.\n*   **Retail Speculation & Meme Nostalgia:** Continued references to Michael Burry, GME, and \"the plumbing\" show a segment of retail remains engaged with 2021-era conspiracy/meme narratives, representing a latent source of non-fundamental volatility.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Strong Sell Signal - Energy Complex:** Oil breaking multi-year support is a critical technical and fundamental catalyst. Watch for follow-through selling in energy stocks (XLE) and energy junk bonds.\n*   **Corporate Warning Signal:** Ford's massive charge and strategic reversal away from pure-play EV is a significant catalyst for the auto sector, potentially re-rating legacy automakers and pressuring EV-only names.\n*   **Labor Market Deterioration:** The November jobs report (highlighted on Reddit) and Bloomberg's article on growing unemployment are key data catalysts contradicting the Fed's primary inflation focus. This increases uncertainty around the Fed's reaction function.\n*   **M&A & Restructuring Catalyst:** Kraft Heinz's pre-split CEO change and Apollo's potential $12B Atlas Air sale are active corporate events that will create single-stock volatility and sector speculation.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Demand Shock Acceleration:** Oil's plunge may be forecasting a sharper global slowdown than priced in.\n    2.  **Policy Error:** Risk of the Fed remaining overly hawkish as unemployment rises (stagflation-lite scenario).\n    3.  **Credit Event Spillover:** High-profile losses (Carlyle) and bankruptcies signal stress in private credit and leveraged loans.\n    4.  **Retail Liquidation:** Desperate retail options plays (e.g., SPY puts) could exacerbate downside moves if they are forced to cover.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Long Volatility:** The disconnect between low VIX and high negative catalyst density presents an opportunity.\n    2.  **Beneficiaries of Lower Oil:** Transportation (airlines, trucking), chemical companies, and consumer discretionary sectors stand to gain from input cost relief.\n    3.  **Strategic M&A:** The environment is forcing corporate action (splits, sales, pivots), creating event-driven opportunities.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n*   **SECTOR: ENERGY (XLE) - AVOID/UNDERWEIGHT.** The technical and fundamental breakdown in oil is severe. Avoid catching the falling knife. Downside risk remains high.\n*   **SECTOR: TRANSPORTATION (IYT) - WATCH FOR RELATIVE STRENGTH.** Major cost headwind (fuel) is collapsing. Monitor IYT for a breakout relative to the SPY as earnings estimates may see positive revisions.\n*   **VIX / UVXY: MONITOR FOR ENTRY.** The VIX at ~16.5 appears complacent given the macro and sentiment backdrop. Consider long-volatility positions on any market bounce or further breakdown in oil.\n*   **F: SHORT-TERM VOLATILITY PLAY.** The massive strategic pivot will create uncertainty. Expect elevated volatility; trade the range, not the direction.\n*   **KHC: EVENT-DRIVEN WATCH.** CEO change ahead of a split is a classic corporate action sequence. Watch for analyst day or split details for a catalyst.\n*   **MACRO: WATCH 10Y-2Y TREASURY SPREAD.** With rising unemployment and hawkish Fed talk, monitor the yield curve for any steepening (growth fears) or further inversion (recession fears).\n\n---\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market is facing a deflationary commodity shock and mounting labor market softness, creating a bearish macro tilt. Institutional news flow is cautious, while retail sentiment is fearful and speculative. **Tactical positioning should be defensive, favoring volatility hedges and sectors that benefit from falling input costs, while avoiding energy and high-beta speculation.** The key near-term watch is for a volatility spike (VIX >20) to confirm the bearish shift.",

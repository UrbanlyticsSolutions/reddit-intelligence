      "content": "Amazon releases an impressive new AI chip and teases a Nvidia-friendly roadmap\n\nAmazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs.\nThe cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at its AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product in on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.\n\nAWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation, according to AWS.\nAWS says the systems are more than four times faster, with four times more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10 times the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. \nPerhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation.  While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.\nIt is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscience way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  \nAWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, Splashmusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. \n\n\nAWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step-up in performance and support Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  \nThis means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon’s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  \nIt’s worth noting, too, that Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), has become the de facto standard that all AI apps support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon’s cloud.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/",

Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026.\n\nGiannandrea will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft. Before that, he worked at Google’s DeepMind, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nSubramanya will be Apple’s vice president of AI, the company said, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple said Giannandrea would remain as an advisor until next spring.\n\nIn a statement, Cook said that Federighi already played a key role in Apple’s AI efforts. Federighi is Apple’s top software executive.\n\n“In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,” Cook said in a statement.\n\nSubramanya will lead teams at Apple working on the company’s foundation models, research, and AI safety, the company said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai.html)",

      "content": "Michael Burry Calls Out Tesla Stating They Are \"Ridiculously Overvalued\"\n\n“Big Short” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter, calling the electric-vehicle maker “ridiculously overvalued” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern. Burry argued that Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders.\n\nBurry cited Tesla’s SEC filings showing that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market.\n\nHe noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution.\n\nBurry also referenced Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards.\n\nTesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels. Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.",

Should I borrow more?\n\n[Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l9z4yl/i_borrowed_5m_to_invest_should_i_borrow_more/), I had a $2.1M account with $1M in gains.\n\nIn 6 months, the account grew another **+$470K** so I'm at **+$1.5M** of total gains [since my first post 5 and a half years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/). I did withdraw $250K to buy a new home, so the account sits at $2.3M.\n\n[Ending - Net Deposits = +$1.5M in gains](https://preview.redd.it/322xfhvafn4g1.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8021b1db3c461e3dc6645fdaac8c026e4e3f7eb0)\n\n  \n That's a +27% compound return a year for nearly 6 years.

I'm under-leveraged, I know. The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage. I haven't decided.\n\nSummary:\n\n\\- Borrow 2-4x the value of your account on margin.\n\n\\- Dump it all in a multi-asset, diversified portfolio. For the stock sleeve, I prefer smart-beta funds due to their higher expected returns. **The goal is maximum compound returns.**\n\n[Positions: Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and $5M borrowed in Box Spread Options](https://preview.redd.it/a9q7blx3sn4g1.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d605f7cd0a610c53acd85f9236514de55ad7b)\n\n\n\nQ&amp;A\n\n1) *When will you de-lever/pay-off the debt/liquidate?*\n\n\\- Never. This maximizes returns. Why do anything but this?\n\n2) *What's it like for your account to grow +$1M per year?*\n\n\\- It's cool, you should try it. Save what you can, invest it like this and give it time. I started with just $20K in 2017.\n\n*3) Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere?*\n\n\\- I have every penny riding in here. Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27% per year so why do that?",

Like literally the whole thing runs on “confidence,” “sentiment,” “vibes,” whatever you wanna call it. Earnings matter yeah, interest rates matter yeah, but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it’s worth buying. People hold because they trust it’ll go back up. People panic because they think someone else is panicking.\n\nIt’s like one giant circular trust fall. Everyone is basically agreeing not to look down.\n\nAnd then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense? Like not a normal recession or correction, but a day where enough people say “nah I’m done trusting this casino.” Would everything just… unwind? Would indexes tank for years? Would governments step in and force something? Or does the system somehow survive because it’s too big to fail, like people will keep believing simply because they have no choice?\n\nIdk maybe I’m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is. Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating?",

      "content": "OpenAI declares ‘code red’ as Google catches up in AI race\n\nThe Verge, Dec 2, 2025\n\nGoogle’s own ‘code red’ response to ChatGPT has started paying off.\n\nThe tides are turning in the AI race, and the pressure is getting to OpenAI. Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in.\n\nIn the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said.\n\nThere will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development.\n\nThe newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.\n\nSource: https://www.theverge.com/news/836212/openai-code-red-chatgpt",

If Amazon can offer decent performance for less, there’s definitely a market for it.\n\nBut there’s a catch.  \nTrainium3 doesn’t have anything close to Nvidia’s software ecosystem.

He frequently referenced the market being way too expensive consistently sitting at 20-25X earnings, and mentioned several times that the USA had reached its “apex” (peak) and indexes may not be wise investments as the nation may see prolonged stagnation in terms of growth and earnings — which is why he spent the last chapters of his life seeking value in China, which seemed to disappoint him just as many times as it helped him due to the strict corporate regulations and oversight. \n\nI know it’s just one grumpy old man’s opinion, but it’s very disheartening to see a man who went from bankrupt to billionaire in a little over 30 years, largely through marketable securities, almost blow off the future of investing.

      "content": "A 'seismic' Nvidia shift, AI chip shortages and how it's threatening to hike gadget prices\n\nAnalysts are starting to flag a new concern: the AI boom is beginning to strain global chip supply chains in a way that could eventually push up the cost of consumer electronics — including smartphones. AI data centers require massive numbers of GPUs and supporting components, and companies like Nvidia, AMD, Google, and Microsoft are all drawing from the same pool of suppliers. As demand accelerates, several parts of the supply chain are struggling to keep up. Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu recently described the situation as “undersupply,” pointing to shortages across chip manufacturers, memory suppliers, and storage device makers and said the bottleneck could last two to three years.\n\nConsultants at Bain &amp; Company highlighted two immediate pressure points: **Hard disk drives (HDDs):** Hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft have pushed HDD capacity to the limit. **Solid-state drives (SSDs):** With HDDs running short, big cloud companies are shifting toward SSDs the same components used in consumer electronics. On top of that, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a stacked version of DRAM crucial for Nvidia’s latest AI chips, is also in tight supply. These constraints ripple backward through the semiconductor ecosystem and raise the cost of parts used in everyday devices. As AI infrastructure spending surges, several key components are facing multi-year shortages. That raises the risk of higher prices — or even limited availability — for some consumer tech products if supply doesn’t catch up soon.",

Speaking at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo, Son said he “was crying” as SoftBank offloaded the stock, which brought in roughly $5.83 billion.\nAccording to Son, the sale wasn’t about lack of confidence in Nvidia. Instead, SoftBank needed the capital to fuel massive upcoming AI investments, including larger bets on OpenAI, data-center infrastructure under the Stargate Project, and its chip ambitions via Ampere Computing. Son reiterated that SoftBank is “all in” on AI and hinted that the firm may expand its OpenAI investment depending on future valuations. SoftBank’s focus on AI has already paid off the conglomerate’s Q2 net profit more than doubled, aided by valuation gains tied to OpenAI. Despite growing market concerns about a potential AI bubble, Son dismissed the skepticism, saying those calling it a bubble are “not smart enough.” He predicts that advanced AI systems and AI robotics could eventually generate at least 10% of global GDP, justifying the scale of current investment.For Son, selling Nvidia shares wasn’t a statement about the chip giant it was a sacrifice to fund what he sees as the next wave of global technological transformation.",

      "content": "Trump expects the Federal Reserve chair nominee to be announced “early next year” and praised Hassett.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his choice for Federal Reserve chair in early 2026 and hinted that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett could be his pick, further fueling speculation about the next leader of the U.S. central bank.\n\n“We may announce the new chair of the Federal Reserve early next year,” Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting.\n\nLast week, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Hassett was considered a potential successor to Powell, and Trump also endorsed this position at another event shortly after Tuesday's cabinet meeting.\n\n“I guess the potential candidate for Fed chair is here too,” Trump said. “I don't know who qualifies for the word ‘potential.’ I can tell you he's a respected individual. Thank you, Kevin.”\n\nTrump's remarks provided a clearer timeline for an announcement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bechtold, who has overseen the selection process, previously indicated the candidate could be revealed around Christmas.\n\nThe president said Tuesday that after consulting with Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Luteinik, he had considered about 10 candidates for the position, but now “we've narrowed it down to one person.”\n\nHowever, it is well known that Trump frequently makes unexpected personnel and policy decisions, meaning the nomination cannot be considered final until formally announced. Other candidates included Federal Reserve Board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Riddell.\n\nFor months, Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's term expires in May, and appointing his successor will be Trump's biggest opportunity yet to reshape the Fed. Trump has criticized Powell for being too slow and cautious on rate cuts, expressing hope that his replacement would push for reductions more aggressively.\n\nTrump again criticized Powell on Tuesday, calling him a “stubborn guy who probably doesn't like your president.” Although Powell's term as chairman ends next year, he could remain on the board as a governor for two more years.\n\nIn September, Trump explicitly named Hassett, Wash, and Waller as his top three candidates. Trump has also repeatedly expressed his desire for Cent to serve as Treasury Secretary, but the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly declined the offer.\n\nThe selection of the Federal Reserve Chair and Board members typically represents the most direct avenue for the President to influence the central bank. However, Trump has consistently criticized the Fed publicly for its sluggish response in lowering borrowing costs and for spending lavishly on renovating its headquarters. Additionally, the White House has filed a lawsuit over Trump's attempt to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\n\nWhoever Trump selects as Fed chair will require Senate confirmation. If the nominee is an outsider, they are likely to receive a 14-year term as a Fed governor, beginning February 1.",

      "title": "Greencoat UKW",
      "content": "Greencoat UKW\n\nThere is constant criticism that this sub doesn't contain high quality posts anymore so as the newest member to the mod team I thought I would do my best to be a part of the solution. If you would prefer to view the thesis somewhere more pleasing to the eye and including relevant graphs and figures then here is a google docs link: [Greencoat UKW](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vST_XMTNnE6VXIs34kI2eqEGNMlPCtUQNJ3CU55bC5Rh1jioh0XW7hy9gCroQ0rmf716Kp-NEKt94QR/pub)\n\nNo AI was used in the making of this other than running calculations that I double checked.\n\n\n\n# Fund Summary\n\nGreencoat UK Wind PLC is a renewable infrastructure fund, invested exclusively in UK wind farms. The fund’s aim is to provide investors with an annual dividend that increases in line with RPI inflation while preserving the capital value of its investment portfolio in the long term on a real basis through reinvestment of excess cash flow.\n\nThe fund is one of the few FTSE 250 listed stocks to raise their dividend for nearly 10 years straight and very well positioned to sustain the dividend growth through the high inflationary period due to revenues being explicitly and implicitly tied to inflation.\n\n# Section 1) Reasons for Discount to Market Cap\n\n# Interest Rates\n\nFor the first \\~7 years of the fund’s life since IPO in 2013 the share price has traded at a modest premium to the NAV however since 2022 that has changed. Over the last 3 years the stock price has slowly traded at a larger and larger discount to NAV with the latest calculation being 140.7p NAV and 99.65p SP meaning a (41.05/140.7p​)×100≈29.17% discount to current NAV.\n\nWhen the “risk free” rate for investors increases, investors demand a higher-dividend yield to assume the risk of owning the fund instead of long term government bonds. Therefore, the stock is sold off until the dividend yield hits a premium more worth the risk. To represent this in the NAV, the fund changed the discount rate it used to calculate current value of future cash flows. NAV is highly sensitive to the discount rate of future cash flows as that causes the current value of those cash flows to be worth far less. As you can see from the 10 Year Gilt rates, 2022 is when the yields started rising due to geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine, which means the discount rate that they used for their calculation of NAV went up from 7% (2021) to 11% (2024) and is the main cause for the declining NAV in that period.\n\nIn their most recent half yearly report, Greencoat state that 0.5% increase in interest rates has a 6.3p negative effect on NAV. While this is offset by increased revenues due to inflation-indexed subsidies and higher realised price per MW/H, it’s overall a largely negative effect on current value of future cash flows.\n\n# Switching to CPI from RPI\n\nThe government is trying to switch everything to track CPI instead of RPI, as it’s the global standard and also reduces its costs. In 2020, it confirmed that the inflation indexed bonds that were previously issued would be switched without any compensation for bond holders.\n\nThe government recently started a discussion into whether payments under the RO and Feed In Tariff schemes should also be switched to CPI. It is also considering freezing rates until backdated “shadow” CPI levels catch up. This would hugely affect renewable energy providers and, as stated by UKW, would drop the NAV by 2.4p for an instant switch to CPI at current levels and by 10.6p for freezing and re-aligning with the “shadow” amount.\n\n# Reduced Average UK Wind Speeds\n\nOver the past 4 years, wind speeds in the UK have been lower than average. This has caused power generation to be well under budgeted estimates and has resulted in lower-than-expected cash flows and therefore smaller dividend cover. This has meant less excess cash to re-invest to maintain NAV and is also likely a cause for investors being cautious in believing NAV calculations.\n\n# Section 2) Management\n\n# Cost of Management\n\nEffective from 1 January 2025, the management fee for running the fund has been based on the lower of the NAV or Market Cap. This is a very shareholder-friendly change which means the management fees are cheaper when the share price is trading at a discount. Based on the earlier calculation of discount to NAV, this means that the fees are also ≈29.17% cheaper.\n\n# Capital Allocation\n\nCapital allocation at the fund since the IPO has been fantastic. They have continuously made decisions that boost the NAV. During periods where the share price was trading at a premium to NAV per share, they did equity financing (share dilution) to raise capital and buy more assets. Whilst many shareholders see dilution as bad for shareholders, when it’s done at above NAV it is accretive for NAV per share.\n\nSince the shares have recently started trading at a discount to NAV, Greencoat have been doing buybacks with excess cash flows because this also increases the NAV per share by reducing shares outstanding. The fund’s ability to be dynamic with its capital allocation will allow them to continue outperforming the market in the long run. The increase in the size of the market for UK wind assets is also likely to provide opportunities to get assets at great prices going forward, as a lot of capital will be required in the industry.\n\n# Section 3) Key Risks\n\n*In no particular order:*\n\n**1.Change from RPI to CPI:** The biggest near-term risk is the potential shift in the indexation measure from RPI to CPI. These will be accounted for in my calculation of expected returns below.\n\n\n\n**2. Reduction of average UK wind speeds:** ([UK wind power potential could fall by 10% by 2100 because of climate change - Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-wind-power-potential-could-fall-2100-because-climate-change/)) There are some studies that suggest we could see lower average wind speeds going forwards, due to climate change. The fund has reduced their estimation of future average wind speeds even though there is no real conclusive evidence that it will happen.\n\n\n\n**3. Valuation Risk:** The fund doesn’t disclose exactly how they calculate NAV and there is some risk that they have made overly optimistic assumptions in this calculation. It’s hard to pin these down but here are some potential worries:\n\na) **Consistently Overestimating Power Generation:** As listed in the ‘UK average wind speeds’ section above, every single year going back to 2016 the fund has underdelivered on power generation, even when UK average wind speeds were higher than expected. This could suggest some incorrect assumptions in the NAV.\n\nb) **Decommissioning Liabilities:** (Source: [Greencoat Flapping in the Wind - by David Turver](https://davidturver.substack.com/p/greencoat-flapping-in-the-wind)) \n\n“Note 10 to their accounts identifies about £280m of guarantees and indemnities made by the company to cover things like decommissioning and other indemnities. However, Note 2 records that they consider the fair value of these indemnities to be zero because they “do not expect Group cashflows to crystalise as a result of these guarantees”.\n\nHowever, this might not be the full extent of the under-recording of decommissioning liabilities. For instance, Note 10 indicates a guarantee to the Crown Estate of £3.4m for the decommissioning of Rhyl Flats offshore wind farm. However, the 2023 accounts for[ Rhyl Flats](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/05485961/filing-history) shows the present value of decommissioning liabilities of £29.2m. Grossing this up using their discount rate of 3.75% to the expected life of 23 years gives an expected cash cost of some £40.7m in 2032. UKW owns 24.95% of Rhyl Flats, so its share of the total would be £10.2m, three times more than the amount recorded in Note 10.\n\nSimilarly, they record in Note 10 a guarantee of £11.8m to cover decommissioning and rent for[ North Hoyle](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/02904841/filing-history) wind farm. However, the 2024 accounts declare a provision for decommissioning with a present value of £12.1m. Grossing this up to their discount rate of 6% out to 2034 gives a cash cost of £21.7m. UKW owns 100% of North Hoyle, so it will be on the hook for the entire amount, nearly double the recorded guarantee.”\n\n\n\n**4.Political Risk:** The conservative party has stated that they would scrap certain renewable subsidies if they were in government and Reform would likely try to do the same. Whilst these subsidies are bound by contract and likely hard to legally get out of, this still poses a risk of impacting future cash flows. The only way to account for this would be to use a lower growth rate for NAV in expected returns as a form of margin of safety.\n\n\n\n**5. Assets Life Risk:** The fund lists asset life as one of its keys risks and says “In the event that the wind turbines do not operate for the period of time assumed by the Group or require higher than expected maintenance expenditure to do so, it could have a material adverse effect on investment returns.\n\nThe Group performs regular reviews and ensures that maintenance is performed on all wind turbines across the wind farm portfolio. Regular maintenance ensures the wind turbines are in good working order, consistent with their expected life-spans.”\n\n\n\n**6. Electricity Prices:** Quite obvious, but a material drop in energy prices for an extended period of time would substantially hurt the fund’s cash flows. This risk feels very small to me – with huge data centres the increased load to the grid for electric cars and a widespread shift away from fossil fuel generation demand for power is very likely to stay high. They are also calculating NAV based on their realised price per MW/H dropping from £60 down to below £40 in 2060.\n\n# Section 4) Expected Returns\n\nTo make it easy, I will just calculate NAV and assume dividends are left in cash within the fund. (Rate of return will be higher if, at below NAV, dividends are re-invested and/or buybacks happen.)\n\n# Optimistic Outlook: Share Price Returns to NAV within 3 years and NAV grows at 10% (The fund’s target)\n\n**Current Share Price:** 99.65p\n\n**NAV After 3 years:** 187.27p  \nEnding NAV=140.7p×(1.10)\\^3=187.27p\n\n**Total Return Over 3 Years:**  \nTotal Return=(Ending NAV/Starting SP)​−1 =(187.27p/99.65p)​−1≈1.8793−1=87.93%\n\n**Annualised Rate of Return (CAGR):**  \nCAGR=((1+Total Return)\\^⅓)−1  \nCAGR=((1.8793)\\^⅓)−1≈0.2340=**23.40%**\n\n# Base Case: Switch to CPI instantly (-2.4p NAV), Share Price Returns to 90% of NAV within 3 years and NAV grows at 8%\n\n**Current Share Price:** 99.65p\n\n**NAV After 3 years:** 174.22p  \nEnding NAV=138.3p×(1.08)\\^3=174.22p\n\n**Total Return Over 3 Years:**  \n Total Return=(Ending NAV/Starting SP)​−1 =(174.22p/99.65p)​−1≈1.7483−1=74.83%\n\n**Annualised Rate of Return (CAGR):**  \nCAGR=((1+Total Return)\\^⅓)−1  \nCAGR=((1.7483)\\^⅓)−1≈0.2047=**20.47%**\n\n# Pessimistic Outlook: Freeze at current rate and switch to “shadow” CPI Rate (-10.6p NAV), Share Price Stays at current discount to NAV and NAV grows at 8% for 3 years\n\n**Current Share Price:** 99.65p\n\n**Starting NAV** 130.1p\n\n**Nav After 3 Years:** 174.22p  \nEnding NAV=130.1p×(1.08)\\^3=163.89p\n\n**Current Discount:** 1−(99.65p/140.7p)=**29.17%**\n\n**End Price with Discount:** 163.89p\\*(1-0.2917)=116.08p\n\n**Total Return Over 3 Years:**  \n Total Return=(Ending NAV/Starting SP)​−1 =(116.08p/99.65p)​−1≈1.1649−1=**16.49%**\n\n**Annualised Rate of Return (CAGR):**  \nCAGR=((1+Total Return)\\^⅓)−1  \nCAGR=((1.1649)\\^⅓)−1≈0.05=**5%**\n\nFor this pessimistic outlook to be true, the worst-case decision for the switch to CPI would need to happen (this would hugely disincentivise future investment in renewables, making net-zero 2050 and clean power by 2030 a lot harder to achieve) plus the fund would have to miss its target returns by 2% annually. I’ve chosen 2% to account for the fact that Greencoat have missed their generation estimates by an average of 2.4% since 2013. In their 2024 annual report they revised future estimated wind speeds down by 2.4% (conveniently similar) but I’m just being conservative. All of this, as well as the fund still trading at a 29% discount to ending NAV, means I calculate the CAGR is still 5%.\n\n# Section 5) Potential Tailwinds Not Included\n\nAll of the above is very much looking into worst case scenarios, I'm very much of the opinion that 1st priority in investing should be making sure that you don’t lose money and the upside will take care of itself. That being said here are some of the things that could materially increase returns:\n\n1. Reduction in interest rates would hugely boost NAV. For example, if interest rates in 3 years were 2% then that would add 26.8p to current NAV.\n2. Rise in electricity costs would increase dividend coverage and allow buybacks and potential acquisitions of new sites to increase NAV – or simply allow for special one-time dividends like they have done in the past (should be a last resort if no other capital allocation is available at high compound rate of returns).\n3. An expected increase in on-shore windfarms by 2x and off-shore by 3x means that constructors will be looking for lots of buyers to free up capital to start on new projects, potentially creating opportunities for effective use of capital at higher rates of return.\n4. Buybacks at current prices are VERY efficient due to the discount to NAV and reduce the dividend burden by reducing shares outstanding.\n5. The stock price could return to NAV at a faster rate than 3 years, which would make CAGR for the investment higher but over less time.\n6. Stock price could return to trading at a premium to NAV like it did for the first 7 years of the fund's life.\n7. Battery storage on site at wind farms could increase returns by allowing flexibility for delivering power at periods with the highest demand. This currently does not offer good rates of return but as battery technology improves it’s something the fund is investigating. (Wind power provides the best opportunity for this as a lot of power is generated overnight during periods of low demand)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThanks very much if you got this far, you have a much better attension span than most, please do let me know what you think and no need to be too kind, feel free to rip my thesis apart.\n\nI do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.\n\nI have taken a 20,000 share position and will be looking to build on it should there be any further discount to the stock price.",

This chess move by NVDA will shift the R&amp;D hardware standard from CPUs to GPUs, thus creating a new secondary moat for NVDA.\n\nThe rest of the Mag7 (AMZN, AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL and TSLA) are using Synopsis EDA software to design their custom silicon (Trainium, M-series, MTIA, Maia, TPU and AI5/6). The NVDA AI GPUs will fast track the design output, however there would be a design bias (via training data and hardware optimisation) that would result in the custom silicon chips being similar to NVDA GPUs. This is a defensive play to prevent the rise of non-GPU disruptive custom silicon. Also, increases the NVDA CUDA moat.\n\nExciting times ahead!",

Account (1) is 50% equities, Account (2) is 65% equities, and Account (3) is 80% equities.\n\nThe theory is that we'd use up all of Account (1) before turning to the first dollar of Account (2) (which incurs income tax but no age penalty), and we'd use up all of Account (2) before the first dollar of Account (3) (which incurs both income tax and age penalties for another 5 years).\n\nAdvice about the overall allocation is welcome, but the real question is how to treat the three separate accounts. So do those allocations make sense?  Or should Account (1) have ***all*** of the safe stuff, and should Account (3) be ***all*** equities?\n\nThanks...",

      "content": "Ever looked into ETFs that let you invest in private companies early?\n\nSo I was reading about an ETF that lets regular folks get in on private companies before they go public. Usually the really fast-growing stuff happens in private markets first, and by the time they IPO, most people miss out. One ETF called XOVR is a crossover ETF that mixes private companies with public companies to give earlier exposure. Has anyone tried this kind of ETF? Does it actually help spread risk, or is it more complicated than it sounds?",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Time Horizon:** Day | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-02 13:55:25 | **Sentiment:** **Bearish with Elevated Systemic Risk**\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Bearish**\nThe data points to a **bearish and anxious** market environment dominated by systemic risk concerns and political uncertainty. Retail sentiment (Reddit) is alarmist, focusing on potential financial stress (repo market, bank collateral). Institutional news (RSS) is preoccupied with policy volatility under the Trump administration. Market data shows mixed sector performance but low volumes, suggesting cautious, directionless trading. The elevated VIX (17.24) and high equity risk premium (4.33%) confirm a risk-off tilt.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES:**\n*   **Systemic Financial Risk:** The dominant retail narrative is a potential liquidity/collateral crisis in the banking system, highlighted by the \"overnight repo flashing red\" discussion. This is a critical watch item.\n*   **Policy & Political Volatility:** Multiple threads discuss Trump-era policies impacting markets: tariff lawsuits (Costco), regulatory shifts (mileage rules, USDA funding), and their direct economic consequences.\n*   **Sector-Specific Catalysts:**\n    *   **Semiconductors:** Bullish catalyst from Samsung's massive memory price hike (+60%) contrasts with bearish sentiment on financials.\n    *   **AI & Tech:** Continued focus (Amazon's new AI chip, MongoDB gain) but within a broader cautious framework.\n*   **Retail Trading Frenzy Resurgence:** Mentions of GME warrants, Robinhood \"gambling,\" and broker restrictions (Schwab) indicate heightened speculative activity in meme stocks, often a contrarian indicator for broader market stability.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS:**\n*   **Red Flag Signal:** The Reddit discussion on banks dumping MBS for cash in the repo market, if accurate, is a **major liquidity warning signal** reminiscent of pre-stress periods. This requires immediate verification from primary sources (Fed balance sheet data, SOFR rates).\n*   **Positive Catalyst:** **Samsung's 60% memory chip price hike** is a powerful, fundamental positive for the semiconductor memory sector (MU, WDC, STX) and related equipment.\n*   **Policy Catalyst:** **Trump's move to ease mileage rules** is a direct positive for automakers (F, GM) and negative for EV pure-plays reliant on regulatory tailwinds.\n*   **Contrarian Indicator:** The surge in retail discussion around GME and options restrictions suggests this segment is overheated and prone to a sharp reversal.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Systemic Liquidity Risk:** The potential for a collateral/liquidity squeeze in the banking system is the top macro risk. This could trigger a broad market sell-off.\n    2.  **Policy Uncertainty:** Unpredictable fiscal and trade policies are creating winners and losers arbitrarily, increasing volatility and sector rotation risk.\n    3.  **Retail Speculation Bubble:** Concentrated frenzy in meme stocks increases the risk of a sharp, sentiment-driven correction that could spill over.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Semiconductor Supply Chain:** The memory shortage and price surge create a clear opportunity in chipmakers, memory producers, and equipment suppliers.\n    2.  **Defensive Positioning:** High risk premium and volatility favor defensive assets (gold - GLD at $387.19 is a hedge) and sectors less sensitive to funding stress.\n    3.  **Regulatory Beneficiaries:** Traditional automakers stand to benefit from relaxed mileage regulations.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:**\n*   **SECTOR: Semiconductors (Memory) - BULLISH**\n    *   **Insight:** The Samsung price hike is a fundamental game-changer. Favor companies in the memory and storage ecosystem. This is the clearest fundamental trade in the data.\n*   **SYMBOL: INTC - MONITOR FOR FOLLOW-THROUGH**\n    *   **Insight:** Up 8.65% on the snapshot, likely benefiting from the semiconductor theme. Assess volume and news for continuation. Could be a catch-up play.\n*   **SECTOR: Traditional Automobiles - BULLISH**\n    *   **Insight:** Policy shift away from stringent mileage rules reduces cost pressure and regulatory risk for legacy OEMs. Favor over EV sector in the short term.\n*   **MACRO: CRITICAL WATCH - REPO MARKET & BANK LIQUIDITY**\n    *   **Insight:** Immediately monitor the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Fed balance sheet data (reverse repo usage). A sustained spike would validate the Reddit fear and warrant a significant reduction in overall equity exposure, particularly in financials (XLF).\n*   **SYMBOL: GME / MEME STOCKS - HIGH RISK**\n    *   **Insight:** The combination of high retail chatter, warrant anomalies, and broker restrictions signals extreme speculative froth. **Avoid new long positions.** This is a prime candidate for a sharp, sentiment-driven collapse.\n*   **ASSET CLASS: Volatility & Hedges - CONSIDER**\n    *   **Insight:** With VIX elevated and systemic risks looming, consider maintaining or adding portfolio hedges (e.g., long VIX strategies, put options on broad indices like SPY) as insurance against a potential liquidity event.\n\n**CONCLUSION:** The market is sending conflicting signals: a powerful fundamental tailwind for semiconductors against a backdrop of severe macro financial anxiety. **The highest priority action is to investigate the repo market stress signal.** Until that risk is clarified, any bullish positioning (e.g., in semis) should be sized cautiously and hedged. Policy volatility favors tactical, news-driven sector rotations over broad index investing.",

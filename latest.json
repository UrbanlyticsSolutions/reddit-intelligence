      "title": "NBIS is a steal at this price, change my mind",
      "content": "NBIS is a steal at this price, change my mind\n\nI’m currently averaged at $96 on Nebius and I definitely wish I’d waited a bit longer to build my position. At these levels though, I genuinely think the stock is massively undervalued. A lot of the recent decline feels driven by bad sentiment driven by bad sentiment and a broader sell off after Oracle’s earnings. At current pricing, this looks like one of the biggest steals in the market to me.\n\nHere's why:   \n\n\n**- AI compute is structurally undersupplied.** \n\nThis is not a short cycle issue. Training and inference demand keeps growing faster than GPU supply, power availability and data center capacity. Companies that can actually deliver large scale GPU clusters with power and networking are the bottleneck.\n\nNebius sits right in that bottleneck.\n\n  \n**- Hyperscaler validation matters more than narratives**  \nMicrosoft signed up to $19.4B in multi year GPU capacity. Meta followed with another $3B. These are not pilot projects or optional experiments. This is mission critical infrastructure.\n\nIf Microsoft and Meta are willing to rely on Nebius for AI compute, the tech works and the execution bar has already been cleared at a very high level.\n\n  \n\\- **Extreme growth**   \nQ3 revenue was up 355% YoY.  \nARR today is roughly $550M and guided to ramp to $7–9B by the end of 2026 as contracted capacity comes online.  \nAI operations are already EBITDA positive with margins around 20%.\n\n**- Capex is not the problem people think it is**  \nYes, capex is massive. That is the business. But Nebius is sitting on roughly $5B in cash and raised convertibles at extremely low interest rates. Capital markets are clearly comfortable financing this growth because the demand is locked in by secured deals.\n\n  \n**- This is the most important one, everyone keeps forgetting the extra assets they own besides the cloud business**   \nMost people talk about Nebius as if it’s just an AI cloud provider. That’s missing a big part of the picture.\n\nOn top of the cloud business, Nebius still owns several assets that have real value and are basically being priced at a huge discount or in my opinion even close to zero (!!) by the market right now.\n\nAvride ($2-3B valuation) is now partnered with Uber. Avride is working with Uber on delivery robots, which is a massive market on its own.\n\nThen there’s TripleTen ($300-500M)growing fast in a high margin digital space\n\nOn top of that, Nebius still has stakes in things like AI data annotation and database tech through Toloka and ClickHouse ($2B) . These aren’t random side projects, they sit right in the AI value chain and have raised at serious private valuations in the past.\n\nIf you do even conservative sum of the parts math, you’re talking about several billion in value outside of the core cloud business. Right now, the market seems to be valuing Nebius almost purely as “AI cloud plus execution risk” and ignoring everything else. \n\nIf Nebius actually hits the target of  $7–9B ARR in 2026, you’re looking at a forward revenue multiple of roughly 2.4x for the core cloud business. While others easily have a multiple of 5-10. \n\n**- The real risks**  \nI don't want to turn a blind eye to the risk, because ofc there are:   \n\\- Data center build timelines slipping  \n\\- Customer concentration  \n\\- Share dilution over time\n\nAll real. But they are execution risks, not demand risks. Chance of execution is (in my opinion) the highest at Nebius compared to others, because of their former Yandex experience.   \n  \nThis all seems to good to be true to me, so please convince me if i'm missing something here. Even a base case should provide a valuation of roughly 120-150$ according to my research. \n\n\n\n",

      "content": "NBIS; An Opportunity To Be A Generational Bag Holder\n\nHere is a company whose core business revolves around purchasing costly depreciating GPUs and renting their output out to hyper scalers such as Microsoft at a loss.\n\nTheir subsidiaries are arguably nothing but money-sinks (Clickhouse, AVride, etc.) and are outclassed by numerous competitors such as Snowflake, Starship Technologies, etc.\n\nWhile Revenue has grown 300%+ year over year, expenses have grown at a faster rate and the company is essentially burning through money.\n\n1. Secure a contract at a loss -&gt; \n\n2. Use contract to get a loan/funding -&gt; \n\n3. Build out infrastructure/acquire GPUs -&gt; \n\n4. Repeat -&gt; \n\n5. Hope to eventually become a competing AWS alternative for AI cloud solutions.\n\nThe problem: \n\nToday, the overwhelming majority of NBIS's revenue comes from hyper scalers looking to offload demand. NBIS is providing them the compute at a loss. \n\nAt anytime a hyperscaler(s) can choose to no longer use NBIS when unfavorable, which will completely cripple the company's finances.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are currently investing extremely heavily into their own data centers to keep up with demand, so the chance of Nebius acquiring customers that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, can't provide supply to in the future is low.\n\nThere is also huge uncertainty regarding NBIS's future cashflows, demand, and financial solvency. Shareholders may unknowingly be diluted to raise funds, a forced buy-out can happen, etc.\n\nOverall, NBIS is a great opportunity to become a generational bag holder. Simply ignore the financials and choose to invest off of vibes, chasing hype, etc., and you may potentially find yourself holding a bag for years to come.",

      "content": "The first time I used a crypto-backed loan.... it felt like cheating.\n\nLast winter I tried a crypto-backed loan because I didn’t want to sell my coins. I locked up about $10,000 worth of BTC and borrowed $5,500 cash. The app called that “55% LTV”. All it means is: loan divided by collateral value.\n\nThe terms said a warning would hit around 70% and an auto-sell could happen around 80%. I read it, nodded, and moved on. Big mistake. Because the math changes fast when price drops.\n\nThat night BTC slid hard. My $10,000 collateral became roughly $7,800 in a few hours. My loan was still $5,500, so my LTV jumped to about 70%+. I got a message: “margin call, 24 hours to cure.” Cure means add more collateral or repay part of the loan.\n\nI tried adding $1,000 more BTC from another wallet. Network fees were spiking and my transfer sat pending. I tried repaying $500 instead, but my bank transfer wouldn’t clear instantly. Support chat replied like “high volume, expect delays.” The timer didn’t care.\n\nBy morning the app showed “partial liquidation executed.” They sold a chunk of my BTC to push the ratio back down, then charged an execution fee on what they sold. I wasn’t wiped out, but I did sell at the worst moment without choosing to.\n\nIf you ever use these loans, assume a 30% drop can happen any random day. Borrow lower than you think, keep extra collateral ready, and make sure you can move money fast.",

      "content": "With all the bubble talk, here's some optimistic data\n\nI'm not going to lie, I'm a little uneasy about this market. P/E ratio is high. Unemployment rate is rising. Stocks have been pretty weak in Q4. High beta stocks have gotten demolished. Buffet's cash pile is at an ATH. Aswath Damodaran is suggesting investors buy collectibles to diversify. The S&amp;P has returned over 20% two years in a row followed by \\~15% so far in '25. There's concerns over Oracle's debt, OpenAI making commitments they can't keep, circular deals, many people even believe we're in a full on bubble.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to point out some data that may make you rethink selling out of your stocks and going to cash.\n\n1. There have only been four years since 1938 where the S&amp;P 500 total return was -18% or worse. 1974, 2002, 2008, and 2022. So 4/87 years. Yes, 18% is somewhat cherry picked and of course cumulative peak to trough drawdowns have been much worse than 18%. But if you bought on the close of the last day of the trading year, you only lost 18% or more over the next 12 months 4.6% of the time.\n2. The S&amp;P 500 PEG ratio is currently 1.2 which is roughly about average since 1995. It was above 1.6 in 2016. Above 1.5 in 2004. And above 1.4 for much of the 2010s. It even got to 2.0 in 2023 but quickly reversed.\n3. The stock market has gone many years without a red total return year several times. Some notable stretches. 2009-2017. 1991-1999. 1982-1989. 1947-1952. So just because we've had three years of strong gains doesn't mean the bull market has to end here and come crashing down.\n4. The trailing P/E of the S&amp;P 500 is being obfuscated by a few highly weighted stocks with abnormal growth rates. Namely Nvidia, which has a 42x trailing P/E but a 22.5x forward P/E. Historically, the largest stocks in the market usually grew at 3-4% per year.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't good reasons to be bearish. I'm not saying that 2026 is going to be a great year. I'm not even saying that you shouldn't reduce risk or that going to cash won't be the right move in hindsight. I'm just trying to provide some balance to the current uneasy feeling many of us have. Earnings growth has been strong, AI could really improve GDP over the next 5-10 years, margins have been steadily increasing for a long time, and interest rates are coming down.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/](https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/)\n\n[https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns)",

      "content": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector\n\nA few weeks ago I saw an interesting post here about the [energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pbgprq/energy_stocks_are_still_cheap_and_nobody_seems_to/) sector. The basic idea was straightforward:\n\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data center capacity planned over the next five years, and data centers are extreme power consumers. In the U.S., a large share of power generation still comes from hydrocarbons, especially natural gas. Companies that provide that energy appear to be overlooked.\n\nWhat that post didn’t get into was a deeper dive into the energy companies themselves — specifically, which ones might actually offer attractive opportunities today.\n\nSo I decided to do that. I used a tool I built that ingests SEC filings for each company and supplements them with industry data from:\n\n* American Petroleum Institute\n* U.S. Energy Information Administration\n* American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers\n* Society of Petroleum Engineers\n* Journal of Petroleum Technology\n* World Oil\n* Oil and Gas Journal\n* Hydrocarbon Processing\n\nI produced 10+ reports across different energy companies. After going through all of them, the companies that stood out to me were:\n\n* [Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/BjArBLK0WHRj) – this was the most interesting to me given that it generated \\~$8.1B of TTM free cash flow in 2024 on a \\~$73B market cap (a mid-teens FCF yield if sustained), while the stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months (+0.9%). It trades at \\~7x EV/EBITDA and \\~12x TTM EPS, despite controlling \\~20.1B boe of long-life 2P oil sands reserves and producing \\~1.36M boe/d. The valuation appears to reflect market skepticism around long-duration durability and Canadian policy risk more than near-term cash generation.\n* [Matador Resources (MTDR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/eXS9JPBjEbOK) – MTDR stood out because balance-sheet stress is not evident in the current numbers: net debt sits below \\~1x EBITDA, production continues to grow in the Delaware Basin, and the company owns majority-interest, largely fee-based midstream assets (San Mateo / Pronto) that support cash-flow stability. Despite this, the stock trades around \\~3x EV/EBITDA, a multiple more commonly associated with higher leverage or structurally challenged E&amp;Ps.\n* [Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/YDjQ0bF0lQjM) – In contrast to the commodity-exposed producers, EPD’s appeal is the consistency of its cash generation: operating cash flow has stayed above \\~$7.5B annually since 2021, distribution coverage has run \\~1.6–1.7x, and the partnership retained \\~$3.24B in 2024 after distributions. Units trade around \\~7.5x EV/EBITDA despite this level of cash-flow stability and balance-sheet strength.\n\nI’m also sharing the reports for the other companies I analyzed in case anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [CHEVRON CORP (CVX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/dPtgVsyaOVZt)\n* [ANTERO RESOURCES Corp (AR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/IDhlgnNAdAUB)\n* [AEMETIS, INC (AMTX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/qWCT1bsvIyDj)\n* [NextDecade Corp (NEXT)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/JJZlaAD3JrFK)\n* [AMEREN CORP (AEE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/bz6cvzIIw5KP)\n* [SM Energy Co (SM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/2rQK36fGNwaD)\n* [Crescent Energy Co (CRGY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/DDSGWbDUlote)\n* [EXXON MOBIL CORP (XOM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/p9Lzg0rb1qKZ)\n* [OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP (OXY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/8ZSEPD2k7oDk)\n* [Vital Energy, Inc. (VTLE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/sYfs8N4YJHVR)\n* [WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. (WMB)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/z2j2kNtxUEXR)\n\nCusious to hear which energy stocks others here are following. Any interesting ones I missed?",

      "content": "All eyes on the bank of Japan - Dec 19\n\n\nThe market is lining up for a big BOJ decision on December 19, and expectations are heavily skewed toward a rate hike. Polymarket is currently pricing in a 98% probability, which tells you how one-sided positioning has become.\nIf the BOJ does hike, the immediate reaction is pretty predictable:\nyen strength, pressure on Japanese equities, and likely some spillover volatility across global markets. Historically, BOJ tightening has caused short-term dips before things stabilize  sometimes even setting up a decent bottom once the event risk clears. That said, with expectations this high, the bigger question might be how much of this move is already priced in. A hike could still cause turbulence, but a surprise hold would be even more disruptive given current positioning.\nCurious to see how others are positioning into this hedge, stay flat, or trade the post-decision reaction?",

Just took control of a £50k+ portfolio I built from savings and side hustles (flipping golf clubs, designer stuff, bit of luck).\n\nIt’s been with the same firm my parents use. They’re about wealth preservation, not growth. Best year I got \\~16% while the S&amp;P 500 did \\~25%. Fees are 1% + 0.5% platform. I don’t even meet their usual client threshold but they still want to keep me, which feels off.\n\nMy aim is long term: save hard, compound, hit my financial goal at 45. With steady contributions and \\~7.5% returns after fees, it’s doable.\n\nThinking of pulling it all out and going DIY passive. Options:\n\n* 80% S&amp;P 500 / 20% Nasdaq (higher growth, higher risk)\n* 70% S&amp;P 500 / 30% global index + a few stocks (more diversified, less tech heavy)\n\nI know people talk about an AI bubble but at my age I think I can ride it out.\n\nSo:\n\n* Is all‑in S&amp;P realistic for a UK investor long term?\n* Is Nasdaq worth the risk or better to diversify?\n* Any regrets from leaving wealth managers and going DIY index funds?\n\nNot after hype, just grounded experiences.

Between the ups and downs of the AI hype cycle, the volatility in crypto, and the broader market swings, I’ve had to adjust my strategy more than once.\n\nIf I had to pick one lesson that stood out, it would be this: I really underestimated the importance of cash management and balanced allocation. There were times I was too aggressive or too concentrated, and it hurt. Looking back, I wish I had focused more on building a portfolio that is steady over the long term but flexible enough to adapt when needed.\n\nCurious to hear from others.

Margins snapped back, cash flow improved, and management gave long-term guidance that points to meaningful scaling from here. So far the stock has moved up **over 30% on the day.**\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, I had a personal fair-value estimate around **$16** before this report. Based on the new numbers and the tone of guidance, I’ve bumped that to roughly **$19.**\n\nDefinitely a name worth checking out if you follow small-cap industrial/aerospace names.

Deadlines start slipping. A team that used to be fast suddenly moves slower.  \nBudgets stretch further than expected. Meetings multiply without producing decisions. Leaders start sensing friction but theyre not sure where it’s coming from. Is it workload imbalance?  A manager overwhelmed? A team operating without clarity? Resources being allocated the wrong way? Or something deeper, like burnout creeping through an entire department? The truth is inefficiency rarely announces itself. It builds quietly, hidden inside tools, systems, and processes that no one has time to examine. By the time the symptoms are loud enough for executives to notice, the problem has already become expensive. HR is expected to diagnose these issues yet theyre asked to do it without the one thing that would make it possible: connected, clear data. You cant fix what you cant see and most inefficiencies stay invisible far longer than they should and HR AI solutions are needed!!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Time Horizon:** Day | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-18 08:31:54\n**Overall Market Sentiment:** **Neutral-to-Cautiously Bearish** with high retail frustration and institutional uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT**\nThe sentiment is fractured and defensive. Reddit shows **high retail disillusionment** (e.g., \"exit liquidity\" posts, NVDA's 20% drop discussion, profit-taking on modest gains). This contrasts with Bloomberg's note on expectations for \"exuberant\" markets in 2026, suggesting a divergence between current pain and future optimism. The VIX at 17.62 indicates **elevated but not panicked** fear. The BOE's dovish guidance being labeled \"lacking\" points to **global policy uncertainty**. Overall, sentiment is wary, driven by tech volatility, political noise, and mixed macro signals.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES**\n*   **Tech & AI Reckoning:** NVDA's sharp correction and ASML's dip on China EUV news highlight **AI/tradeable tech fragility**. Retail feels burned (\"exit liquidity\").\n*   **Political & Policy Dominance:** Trump-related topics (tariffs, media merger, military dividends) and economic assessments are pervasive, indicating markets are highly sensitive to **fiscal and trade policy speculation**.\n*   **Retail vs. Institutional Narrative:** Michael Burry's blame on retail for \"gamma nightmare\" is contested, revealing a **tension in market structure narratives** and who drives volatility.\n*   **Macro-Policy Crosscurrents:** BOE signaling rate cuts but disappointing markets, alongside steady Fed Funds (3.64%) and a 10Y yield at 4.15%, creates a **confusing global rate outlook**.\n*   **Speculative Mania & Bursting Bubbles:** The delisting of \"Penny,\" the 25% surge in DJT on merger news, and the 44% pump in UGRO point to **extreme, low-quality volatility** in speculative pockets.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Negative Catalyst:** **ASML (-6%)** on China EUV reports. This is a critical signal for semiconductor equipment and tech sovereignty themes—a potential long-term headwind.\n*   **Positive Catalyst:** **NVDA showing intraday resilience (+2.4%)** after a severe 45-day drop. This could signal a near-term stabilization or dead-cat bounce attempt.\n*   **Macro Signal:** BOE's Bailey committing to a \"downward path\" for rates while the Fed holds suggests **divergence**, potentially supporting risk assets but weakening GBP.\n*   **Risk-Off Signal:** **Gold (GLD) at $401.35** amidst political noise and equity volatility acts as a steady hedge. The 4.33% equity risk premium is decent but not compelling enough to override fear.\n*   **Sentiment Signal:** **GameStop (GME) closing up 3.34%.** In this environment, it serves as a retail sentiment barometer; its strength suggests the meme/retail cohort remains active, not capitulating.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n**Primary Risks:**\n1.  **Tech Sector Derating:** NVDA and ASML news could precipitate a broader re-rating of overhyped AI and semiconductor stocks. Retail is already feeling this pain.\n2.  **Policy Uncertainty:** Trump-related tariff and fiscal promises create unpredictable trade and inflation outcomes. MillerKnoll's note on \"offsetting tariff costs\" shows this is a real business concern.\n3.  **Speculative Washout:** Extreme moves in low-float, low-quality names (UGRO, VIVK) and delistings signal froth that could drain liquidity from broader markets.\n4.  **China Tech Threat:** ASML's reaction shows market pricing in competitive risks previously dismissed.\n\n**Primary Opportunities:**\n1.  **Stabilizing Tech Leaders:** A capitulation narrative around NVDA could set up a tactical bounce if broader markets steady.\n2.  **Defensive & Real Assets:** Gold (GLD) and utilities may benefit from continued volatility and political uncertainty.\n3.  **Rate-Sensitive Plays:** BOE and eventual Fed dovish pivots could benefit bonds and growth stocks later, but timing is unclear.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**Watchlist & Actions:**\n\n*   **NVDA:** Monitor for a confirmed reversal above $180. Current bounce is tentative. A failure here could lead to a retest of lows, dragging the entire AI complex.\n*   **ASML:** A key bellwether. Further weakness would signal market is pricing in a structural shift in semiconductor competition. **Avoid catching the knife.**\n*   **DJT/Trump Media:** Pure sentiment play. The 25% surge on the TAE merger is high-risk speculation. Watch for volatility spillover into other \"political\" stocks.\n*   **SECTOR: Semiconductors (SMH, SOXX):** Under pressure from both valuation (NVDA) and competition (ASML). **Wait for a base formation** before adding exposure.\n*   **GLD (Gold):** Holding firm. **Consider as a hedge** against political volatility and equity market uncertainty. A break above $405 could signal stronger safe-haven flows.\n*   **SECTOR: Utilities (XLU):** Beneficiary of potential rate cuts and risk-off sentiment. **Outlook improving** on BOE comments and stable Fed funds.\n*   **VIX:** Level of 17.62 suggests options are not overly expensive. **Consider hedging long portfolios** with short-dated calls if equity weakness persists.\n\n**Bottom Line:** The market is in a corrective, news-driven phase. Retail sentiment is poor, but systemic fear is not extreme. **Reduce exposure to high-momentum tech speculations, raise cash, and hedge with defensive assets.** The next major signal will come from whether NVDA can hold its bounce or if the ASML news triggers a broader tech sell-off.",

Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026.\n\nGiannandrea will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft. Before that, he worked at Google’s DeepMind, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nSubramanya will be Apple’s vice president of AI, the company said, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple said Giannandrea would remain as an advisor until next spring.\n\nIn a statement, Cook said that Federighi already played a key role in Apple’s AI efforts. Federighi is Apple’s top software executive.\n\n“In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,” Cook said in a statement.\n\nSubramanya will lead teams at Apple working on the company’s foundation models, research, and AI safety, the company said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai.html)",

      "title": "Michael Burry Calls Out Tesla Stating They Are \"Ridiculously Overvalued\"",
      "content": "Michael Burry Calls Out Tesla Stating They Are \"Ridiculously Overvalued\"\n\n“Big Short” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter, calling the electric-vehicle maker “ridiculously overvalued” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern. Burry argued that Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders.\n\nBurry cited Tesla’s SEC filings showing that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market.\n\nHe noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution.\n\nBurry also referenced Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards.\n\nTesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels. Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.",

Should I borrow more?\n\n[Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l9z4yl/i_borrowed_5m_to_invest_should_i_borrow_more/), I had a $2.1M account with $1M in gains.\n\nIn 6 months, the account grew another **+$470K** so I'm at **+$1.5M** of total gains [since my first post 5 and a half years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/). I did withdraw $250K to buy a new home, so the account sits at $2.3M.\n\n[Ending - Net Deposits = +$1.5M in gains](https://preview.redd.it/322xfhvafn4g1.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8021b1db3c461e3dc6645fdaac8c026e4e3f7eb0)\n\n  \n That's a +27% compound return a year for nearly 6 years. I continue to crush regular, r/stock boomer index fund portfolios:\n\n[I \\(blue\\) am +263&amp;#37; while stocks \\(green\\) are barely +100&amp;#37; over that time period](https://preview.redd.it/hlqiqv1lfn4g1.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc12e2fdda95efb9aef3ec2899f5d6849aaa38c7)\n\nThe account has $7.3M assets and $5M borrowed in options so that's **3.2x** leverage. I'm under-leveraged, I know. The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage. I haven't decided.\n\nSummary:\n\n\\- Borrow 2-4x the value of your account on margin.\n\n\\- Dump it all in a multi-asset, diversified portfolio. For the stock sleeve, I prefer smart-beta funds due to their higher expected returns. **The goal is maximum compound returns.**\n\n[Positions: Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and $5M borrowed in Box Spread Options](https://preview.redd.it/a9q7blx3sn4g1.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d605f7cd0a610c53acd85f9236514de55ad7b)\n\n\n\nQ&amp;A\n\n1) *When will you de-lever/pay-off the debt/liquidate?*\n\n\\- Never. This maximizes returns. Why do anything but this?\n\n2) *What's it like for your account to grow +$1M per year?*\n\n\\- It's cool, you should try it. Save what you can, invest it like this and give it time. I started with just $20K in 2017.\n\n*3) Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere?*\n\n\\- I have every penny riding in here. Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27% per year so why do that?",

      "content": "Amazon releases an impressive new AI chip and teases a Nvidia-friendly roadmap\n\nAmazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs.\nThe cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at its AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product in on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.\n\nAWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation, according to AWS.\nAWS says the systems are more than four times faster, with four times more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10 times the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. \nPerhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation.  While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.\nIt is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscience way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  \nAWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, Splashmusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. \n\n\nAWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step-up in performance and support Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  \nThis means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon’s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  \nIt’s worth noting, too, that Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), has become the de facto standard that all AI apps support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon’s cloud.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/",

Their cloud unit just launched **Trainium3**, a new processor designed to run heavy AI model training at a lower cost and higher efficiency than Nvidia’s GPUs at least according to Amazon.\n\nThe pitch seems clear: companies want cheaper AI compute, and Nvidia’s pricing + demand backlog is still insane. If Amazon can offer decent performance for less, there’s definitely a market for it.\n\nBut there’s a catch.  \nTrainium3 doesn’t have anything close to Nvidia’s software ecosystem. CUDA and the entire Nvidia stack are still massive moats, and they’re the reason companies can deploy models quickly without rewriting everything. Amazon doesn’t have that luxury yet.\n\nIis Nvidia’s dominance still unshakeable because of the ecosystem lock-in or you think Amazon actually becomes a real competitor in AI hardware",

Like literally the whole thing runs on “confidence,” “sentiment,” “vibes,” whatever you wanna call it. Earnings matter yeah, interest rates matter yeah, but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it’s worth buying. People hold because they trust it’ll go back up. People panic because they think someone else is panicking.\n\nIt’s like one giant circular trust fall. Everyone is basically agreeing not to look down.\n\nAnd then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense? Like not a normal recession or correction, but a day where enough people say “nah I’m done trusting this casino.” Would everything just… unwind? Would indexes tank for years? Would governments step in and force something? Or does the system somehow survive because it’s too big to fail, like people will keep believing simply because they have no choice?\n\nIdk maybe I’m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is. Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating?",

As demand accelerates, several parts of the supply chain are struggling to keep up. Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu recently described the situation as “undersupply,” pointing to shortages across chip manufacturers, memory suppliers, and storage device makers and said the bottleneck could last two to three years.\n\nConsultants at Bain &amp; Company highlighted two immediate pressure points: **Hard disk drives (HDDs):** Hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft have pushed HDD capacity to the limit. **Solid-state drives (SSDs):** With HDDs running short, big cloud companies are shifting toward SSDs the same components used in consumer electronics. On top of that, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a stacked version of DRAM crucial for Nvidia’s latest AI chips, is also in tight supply. These constraints ripple backward through the semiconductor ecosystem and raise the cost of parts used in everyday devices. As AI infrastructure spending surges, several key components are facing multi-year shortages. That raises the risk of higher prices — or even limited availability — for some consumer tech products if supply doesn’t catch up soon.",

      "content": "Masayoshi Son Regrets Nvidia Exit but Says SoftBank Needed Capital for OpenAI Push\n\nMasayoshi Son opened up on Monday about SoftBank’s decision to sell its entire Nvidia stake and he didn’t sugarcoat how he felt about it. Speaking at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo, Son said he “was crying” as SoftBank offloaded the stock, which brought in roughly $5.83 billion.\nAccording to Son, the sale wasn’t about lack of confidence in Nvidia. Instead, SoftBank needed the capital to fuel massive upcoming AI investments, including larger bets on OpenAI, data-center infrastructure under the Stargate Project, and its chip ambitions via Ampere Computing. Son reiterated that SoftBank is “all in” on AI and hinted that the firm may expand its OpenAI investment depending on future valuations. SoftBank’s focus on AI has already paid off the conglomerate’s Q2 net profit more than doubled, aided by valuation gains tied to OpenAI. Despite growing market concerns about a potential AI bubble, Son dismissed the skepticism, saying those calling it a bubble are “not smart enough.” He predicts that advanced AI systems and AI robotics could eventually generate at least 10% of global GDP, justifying the scale of current investment.For Son, selling Nvidia shares wasn’t a statement about the chip giant it was a sacrifice to fund what he sees as the next wave of global technological transformation.",

He frequently referenced the market being way too expensive consistently sitting at 20-25X earnings, and mentioned several times that the USA had reached its “apex” (peak) and indexes may not be wise investments as the nation may see prolonged stagnation in terms of growth and earnings — which is why he spent the last chapters of his life seeking value in China, which seemed to disappoint him just as many times as it helped him due to the strict corporate regulations and oversight. \n\nI know it’s just one grumpy old man’s opinion, but it’s very disheartening to see a man who went from bankrupt to billionaire in a little over 30 years, largely through marketable securities, almost blow off the future of investing. He stated numerous times that the upcoming generation should be ready for a lot of disappointment in the markets. \n\nThoughts?",

When including October, November, and December (i.e., Q4), this proportion soars to 71% (9% + 9% + 53%).\n\nAs year-end approaches, fund managers must present their performance to LPs. To make their year-end reports look impressive, they tend to buy the year's best-performing stocks and sell underperforming ones. This collective behavior drives up the prices of strong stocks, pushing the index higher and artificially creating peaks toward the end of the year.\n\nAt the same time, many listed companies plan their share repurchase authorizations on an annual basis. If the budget remains unused by Q4, CFOs often accelerate buybacks in the open market, providing substantial liquidity support to the market.\n\nWhen the market performs reasonably well in the first three quarters, underinvested funds face performance pressure to chase the rally toward year-end, especially around the Christmas period.\n\nStocks w/ potential: NVDA, BGM, WBUY, VRT, HOOD\n\nNot financial advice.",

This is money I have plans for in the short term, so I want to keep it invested conservatively.\n\nMy question is, am I better off investing in NY munis instead? I know you need to consider tax brackets, but when looking at the current yield for VNYTX, it is very close and maybe even more then SGOV. So if the yield is the same, tax brackets don't really matter, why wouldn't you invest in VNYTX and save on both Fed AND State tax?\n\nI know there must be a catch or reason, I just don't know what it is.

Bitget and other plateforme are already running large-scale tokenized stock futures, while the Nasdaq is still waiting on SEC approval before it can offer its own tokenized stock offerings.\n\nI’m starting to think that the Fed’s decision next week might matter less for long-term structure than the shift we’re seeing toward tokenized market rails.  \n\n\nSource: [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-st-futures-muted-as-traders-digest-weak-ism-data-fed-cut-bets-bitcoin-slide-4384983](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-st-futures-muted-as-traders-digest-weak-ism-data-fed-cut-bets-bitcoin-slide-4384983)",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORT**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-02 11:25:29 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: CAUTIOUSLY BEARISH WITH SPECULATIVE POCKETS**\nThe overall sentiment is **bearish-to-neutral**, characterized by high retail skepticism and institutional caution. Key indicators:\n*   **Retail Sentiment (Reddit):** Dominated by themes of economic concern (Black Friday spending, \"S&P 493\"), market structure criticism (taxes, Robinhood gambling, MSTR pyramid scheme), and memestock volatility (GME, MongoDB gain). This reflects a distrustful, risk-aware retail base, not a euphoric one.\n*   **Macro Backdrop:** Elevated VIX (17.24), 10Y Yield (4.02%) above Fed Funds Rate (3.89%), and a high Equity Risk Premium (4.33%) signal investor caution and demand for compensation against risk.\n*   **Institutional Tone (RSS News):** Highlights overvaluation (Burry on Tesla), policy uncertainty (Fed shift pricing), and geopolitical risks (Ukraine debt). The lack of overwhelmingly positive catalysts suggests a defensive posture.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES**\n*   **Economic Fragmentation & Concern:** The \"S&P 493\" narrative and Black Friday spending scrutiny point to intense focus on economic health beyond the \"Magnificent 7.\" Retail is questioning the breadth of the rally.\n*   **Policy & Regulatory Uncertainty:** Themes include tax policy, Trump-era tariff litigation (Costco), Fed policy shifts under a new chair, and SEC regulatory actions (CME clearing house approval).\n*   **Speculative Volatility & Meme Behavior:** Resurgence in memestock/asset discussion (GME warrants, MongoDB gain, Bitcoin shorts) alongside criticism of platform gamification (Robinhood). This is a **contrarian indicator**—when retail focuses on past speculative winners, it often signals a lack of new, fundamental drivers.\n*   **Sector-Specific Supply Shocks:** The Samsung memory chip price hike (+60%) is a major, concrete fundamental catalyst for the semiconductor sector, indicating persistent supply chain issues.\n*   **Valuation Scrutiny:** High-profile calls on overvaluation (Tesla by Burry) and structural criticism (MSTR) highlight a market sensitive to stretched valuations.\n\n### **3. IMPORTANT MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (Bullish):** **Samsung's 60% memory chip price hike.** This is a powerful fundamental signal for semiconductor and hardware margins. It may benefit memory producers (MU, WDC) and equipment suppliers, but pressure downstream OEMs.\n*   **Liquidity Catalyst (Bullish for Crypto):** **Bitcoin nearing $96.9K with $9.6B in potential short liquidations.** This is a significant technical and leverage-based catalyst that could fuel a sharp, volatile rally in crypto-related assets.\n*   **Monetary Policy Catalyst (Dovish/Bullish):** Traders are actively \"pricing in a dovish Fed policy shift\" per Bloomberg. This is the most important macro narrative for the day, potentially supporting equity valuations but weakening the dollar.\n*   **Risk-Off Signal:** The **inverted policy spread** (10Y Yield > Fed Funds Rate) often precedes economic slowing. Coupled with high unemployment (4.4%), it reinforces the cautious macro picture.\n*   **Sentiment Signal:** The extreme, low-volume gain in **PLRZ (+130.06%)** alongside GME warrant chatter confirms elevated, isolated speculative froth—a sign of uneven market participation.\n\n### **4. PRIMARY RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES**\n*   **Risks:**\n    1.  **Macro Disconnect:** The \"S&P 493\" theme risks spreading if economic data softens, leading to a broad derating of non-mega-cap stocks.\n    2.  **Liquidity Shock:** A sudden reversal in Bitcoin could trigger cross-asset volatility, particularly in correlated speculative equities.\n    3.  **Policy Misstep:** Uncertainty around Fed transition and tax rhetoric could freeze capital allocation decisions.\n    4.  **Retail Capitulation:** The cynical, fatigued retail sentiment visible on Reddit can turn into outright selling if markets weaken further.\n\n*   **Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Semiconductor Supply Chain:** The memory price hike creates a clear fundamental tailwind for specific sub-sectors.\n    2.  **Policy Pivot Plays:** Assets sensitive to lower yields (e.g., growth stocks, gold) may benefit from the anticipated dovish Fed shift.\n    3.  **Contrarian Positioning:** High bearish retail sentiment can sometimes set the stage for a short-term relief rally, especially if institutional money rotates into broader indices.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**Watch / Do:**\n\n*   **SECTOR: Semiconductors (Memory & Equipment)** - **Action:** Favor long exposure. The Samsung news is a major, non-speculative margin driver. Focus on pure-play memory makers and capital equipment suppliers.\n    *   **SYMBOLS to Watch:** MU, WDC, LRCX, AMAT.\n*   **SYMBOL: MSTR / Bitcoin-related assets** - **Insight:** Prepare for extreme volatility. The $9.6B Bitcoin short liquidation level is a known \"gamma\" event. A break above could fuel a violent rally, but failure could lead to a sharp pullback. **Trade with strict risk management.**\n*   **THEME: Fed Pivot** - **Insight:** Monitor the 10Y Treasury Yield and the Dollar Index (DXY). A sustained drop in both will confirm the dovish shift is being priced into core assets, benefiting **Gold (GLD)** and long-duration tech.\n*   **SYMBOL: TSLA** - **Insight:** **Heightened downside risk.** Michael Burry's high-profile overvaluation call, combined with general market skepticism, increases the likelihood of underperformance, especially in a risk-off move. Consider hedging or reducing exposure.\n*   **SECTOR: Broad Market (SPY/IVV)** - **Insight:** **Exercise caution.** The combination of high ERP, inverted policy spread, and retail skepticism suggests limited upside for the broad index in the near term. **Watch for a breakdown below key support or a rotation into small/mid-caps (IWM)** as a sign of changing leadership.\n*   **RISK GAUGE: VIX** - **Insight:** A VIX holding above 17 confirms elevated fear. A spike above 20 would signal an escalation in risk-off positioning, warranting a general reduction in equity exposure.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is in a defensive holding pattern, digesting policy shifts and questioning economic resilience. The most actionable, high-conviction signal is the **semiconductor supply shock**. Trade the Fed pivot and Bitcoin liquidation narratives with caution, as they are well-known and crowded. Prioritize selective, fundamental opportunities over broad index bets.",

Ever since the C+35 on the warrants, we have been steadily going up and warrants have been exploding. I believe there are so few warrants available to cover the FTDs for the warrants that they are resorting to buying GME1 options contracts the satisfy the obilagations. By doing so, they are forcing the options MM to hedge and get real shares of GME and to scramble for the warrants they were supposed to have. Hence why both GME and warrants are going up. If warrant demands explodes even more and more retail FOMOS, I think we will see explosions. What are your guy's thoughts?

      "content": "IBM CEO says there is 'no way' spending trillions on AI data centers will pay off at today's infrastructure costs\n\nArvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, has argued that the recent surge in spending by Big Tech on AI-data centers is economically unrealistic. On the “Decoder” podcast he estimated that building and fully outfitting a one-gigawatt AI data center costs about $80 billion. Given that industry announcements suggest firms are planning up to 100 gigawatts of compute capacity, the total capital expenditure could reach around $8 trillion, which would require roughly $800 billion in profits just to cover interest.  \n\n\nKrishna also highlighted that AI hardware like GPUs depreciates quickly and often needs to be replaced roughly every five years, which further undermines long-term financial returns. He said he believes the likelihood of achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI) with current technology is between zero and one percent, making the massive infrastructure bets more speculative than certain. \n\nStill, Krishna acknowledged the potential of today’s AI tools to deliver significant enterprise productivity gains. He cautioned that while infrastructure-heavy “AGI-race” spending may not pay off, more modest, business-focused AI deployments could still be worthwhile.\n\n[Link to article](https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-ceo-big-tech-ai-capex-data-center-spending-2025-12)",

      "content": "ADP data shows sharp slowdown in the U.S. labor market as small businesses struggle\n\nThe latest ADP numbers for November paint a much weaker picture of the labor market than expected. Private employers cut 32,000 jobs, which is a big swing from October’s revised gain of 47,000 and way below the forecast of +40,000.The biggest pressure seems to be on small businesses. Companies with fewer than 50 employees shed a total of 120,000 jobs, the largest drop since March 2023. Medium and large employers actually added workers, with bigger firms showing a net gain of 90,000.Hiring was mixed across sectors. Education and health services added 33,000 jobs, and leisure/hospitality added 13,000. But those gains were offset by declines in professional/business services (-26,000), information (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial and construction (-9,000 each). Wage growth is also cooling, with job-stayers seeing a 4.4% YoY pay increase a slight slowdown from October.This report lands right before the Fed meeting on Dec 9–10. Markets are pricing in nearly a 90% chance of another 25 bps rate cut, but Fed officials remain split: some argue easing is needed to prevent further labor weakness, while others worry cuts could push inflation the wrong way.The BLS nonfarm payrolls data, delayed to Dec 16, will be the next key datapoint.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/adp-jobs-report-november-2025-private-payrolls-unexpectedly-fell-by-32000-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/adp-jobs-report-november-2025-private-payrolls-unexpectedly-fell-by-32000-.html)",

Intrinsic value of time and trials is not priced in.\n\nedit: this sub being against it for vibes instead of science and money is all the proof i need that the stock is down and undervalued due to regards. Reverse reddit. Calls.\n\nAs we all know Moderna came into being as a cancer immunotherapy company then used their tech to create the covid vax and made a ton of money on it so their stock skyrocketed and now its where it started. Since then the trials for their immunotherapy cleared phase 1, 2, and is now a year into phase 3 and its massively successful in clearing cancer in half the patients.\n\nSo we have a product that can generate billions working out and is basically just a couple approvals away from the market. The stock has been shorted to the earth and is stable in the mid 20s while not going further down. So this suggests this is the bottom so already a safe entry point. Low risk of losing any significant amounts. The price factors in lawsuits that will be settled this spring while not factoring in any upside to literal cancer therapies.\n\nbefore anyone comes at me saying its just melanoma; the pipeline works for any cancer and they can use that data to apply for expedited approvals for the rest of the cancer suit.\n\nlower side seems to be non-existent while the up side seems to be 10x.

Fast forward to 10 months later and I increased my position to 10.100 shares for an average of 23.5$ and now Intel is at 43.5$.\n\n  \nThis thing can and, if macro allows, will go a lot higher. We have CES 2026 coming up early January where the Panther Lake chips will be fully revealed on 18A and benchmarks are already promising, then we have rumors about incoming foundry deals and lately a lot of demand for EMIB which is specialized chip packaging. Also Intels discrete GPU division is also looking better than ever (note on this is that we do have to find out how nvidia deal will affect this in the future).\n\n  \nCurrently Intel is at only \\~60% of AMD's market cap while making over two times their revenue. When more of Intels in house chips move to in-house fabbing margins will increase a lot because they don't have to pay TSMC 50% profit margins anymore. Flight potential for this stock is absurd and insanely assymetrical, even after the jump over the past few months.\n\nIn nana we trust.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zkbgas0dz4g1.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=382bb35a03fcb83481ed5c7e1fe7a76ac4e5b5f9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3tqvr8zcz4g1.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73dd2876116b9d739fcd2012a53df85525af60da\n\n  \n",

According to The Information, many sales reps in Azure’s AI unit struggled to hit last year’s growth numbers, especially around the Foundry product the platform companies use to build and manage AI agents. Lowering quotas is apparently unusual for Microsoft, which makes the move stand out. It also raises a question about how quickly enterprise demand for these AI-agent tools is actually scaling versus the expectations that were set last year. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report yet, but if true, it might signal that the enterprise AI ramp-up is going to be more uneven than people assumed. Curious how others read this growing pains, or an early sign that AI adoption inside large companies is slower than the narrative suggests?\n Source : https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/microsoft-stock-ai-foundry-sales.html",

      "content": "SoftBank trims Eutelsat stake, shares drop 7% what’s the real implication?\n\nEutelsat’s stock slipped around 7% this morning after reports surfaced that SoftBank reduced its stake in the company. Given SoftBank had been one of the more notable backers in the OneWeb–Eutelsat merger, the move naturally raised a few eyebrows. Eutelsat is still trying to position itself as a serious competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink, but scaling satellite broadband isn’t cheap, and investor sentiment has been shaky since the merger.A stake cut doesn’t necessarily mean SoftBank is abandoning the story they’ve been reshuffling exposure across different AI and connectivity bets lately but the timing does add pressure, especially when the company is already navigating heavy capex needs and slow commercial uptake compared to Starlink.",

      "content": "Preliminary Analysis for (HG) Hamilton Insurance Group\n\n***Disclaimers:\n\nI am not a financial, accounting, tax, or legal advisor.\n\nThis due diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This “DD” is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should not be treated as definitive proof of any future events (past results are no guarantee of future performance). \n***\n\n\n2025 has been a market-year dominated by growth and enthusiasm in AI, AI infrastructure, and technology in general.  As the year draws to a close, sentiment has shifted to cautious optimism, and investors are looking for signs that the high-hopes of AI companies will indeed produce tremendous value for those businesses into the future.\n\nIn a time like this, it can feel like an odd choice to focus on something as mundane as an insurance company, but great value is hard to ignore.  In stark contrast to some AI-related companies, many of which do not expect to see immediate returns on their large investments in data centers, compute, and development, there must be opportunities in the market that exhibit a strong growth trend while generating free cash flow &amp; earnings for the company and shareholders.\n\nHamilton Insurance Group (HG) is a property, casualty, and specialty insurance/reinsurance company headquartered in Bermuda.  Hamilton Insurance Group was founded in 2013, and was listed on the NYSE in November 2023.  With only 2 years of trading, our data as a public company is limited, but the numbers paint an interesting picture for the investor looking for good value (and who doesn’t want good value?)\n\nHamilton’s gross premiums written have been increasing at a healthy rate over the past 5 years:\n\n2020\t$1,087M\n2021\t$1,447M\n2022\t$1,647M\n2023\t$1,951M\n2024\t$2,423M\n\n2025\t\n\t\tQ1\t843M\n\t\tQ2\t712M\n\t\tQ3\t699M\n\nThis represents an annual growth rate in gross premiums written of 22%.  They are on track for a record year again in 2025.\n\nNext, free cash flow:\n\n2020\t188M\n2021\t227M\n2022\t191M\n2023\t283M\n2024\t759M\n\nFree cash flow growth rate has averaged over 50% for the years shown above.  During Q3 2025, Hamilton Group repurchased shares totaling 40.5M, with $85.8M repurchased YTD.\n\nAs of this writing, Hamilton Group trades at $27.14 per share, with a market cap of $2.67B.  With a trailing twelve month EBITDA of $747M, they trade at just over 3.5X EBITDA, and price to earnings ratio of just 6.5.  Enterprise value of 1.86B puts EV/EBITDA at 2.5, and debt is just 150M.  Trailing twelve month EPS is $4.19\n\nThese are promising numbers when searching for undervalued securities, and some have certainly taken notice with shares up over 45% YTD.  Hamilton Insurance benefited greatly from a relatively tame year for natural disasters, but this of course remains a risk into the future.  However, with the consistent growth in premiums, a combined ratio of just 87.8%, and the positive cash flow and earnings to back it up,  this appears to be an interesting company to watch from a value perspective. \n",

I m long term bullish on the space, but the number of players piling in makes me think we’ll see winners + casualties, not a rising tide for everyone.\n\n\n\nEU considering easing export restrictions on AI chips\n\nIf this actually happens, it could shift supply dynamics and boost some semi names that were stuck in regulatory limbo.\n\n\n\nFrom my seat  someone who mixes long term holdings with short term trades and the occasional options play  today felt like one of those “quietly important” days.\n\nNothing huge… but a lot of small things that could shape how the market trades this week.\n\n\n\nCurious how everyone else is reading today s signals:\n\nAre you leaning risk on, risk off, or just sitting tight for cleaner setups?",

What are the potential drawbacks? Of course it could drop 30% and I’d lose 90% but I would invest even more aggressively in that case and be ok with a longer time frame. \n\nI know people say they aren’t ideal but in the UK it’s the only way I can utilise leverage while being completely tax free.

      "content": "GEAT’s Value Prop Goes Beyond Meals: It Automates A Broken Corporate Process\n\nThe Forbes feature highlights the emotional side of GrеetEat’s model, but the operational side is where the real leverage sits. Companies waste surprising amounts of time routing receipts, validating spend, coding departments, and reconciling reimbursements after every team lunch or client meeting. GrеetEat flips the workflow. Instead of 200 or 600 employees submitting receipts, the host sets a budget, sends vouchers, and the system produces a clean ledger-ready export for the entire event.\n\n\n\nThe advantage is quantifiable. Even a 200 person meeting with a 70 percent redemption rate eliminates about 140 receipts. At 7 minutes each and 50 dollars per loaded finance hour, that is roughly 816 dollars saved per event. Multiply that across recurring onboarding cohorts, monthly team lunches, or cross region client sessions, and it becomes a measurable efficiency tool instead of a culture perk. With the new Forbes visibility layered on top of partnerships like Uber Eats and 8x8, GEAT is entering a different conversation than most microcaps. If the company starts publishing real client wins tied to these savings, how would you evaluate its potential in the broader HR and finance automation space?\n\nNot financial advice. Do your own research.",

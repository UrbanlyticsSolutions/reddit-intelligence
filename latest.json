      "content": "Berkshire is on track to lag behind the S&amp;P 500 in Buffett's last year as CEO\n\nBerkshire Hathaway had a pretty interesting run this year, especially around the time Warren Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of the year. Before that surprise in early May, BRK.B was actually beating the S&amp;P 500 by a wide margin outperformance of over 22 percentage points in 2025.\nThat changed quickly after the announcement. Over the next three months, the stock slid nearly 15% to a low around $459 in early August. Since then, it’s bounced back about 10% and now sits near $504, putting it up roughly 11% for the year.\nThe problem is the broader market hasn’t slowed down. The S&amp;P 500 is up almost 38% since its April low and nearly 17% year-to-date, closing just a few points below its all-time high. Even with Berkshire’s rebound, it hasn’t been able to catch up with that pace. Feels like a year where the market is rewarding risk and momentum more than steady, conservative names. Curious how others see Berkshire here long-term hold as usual, or starting to fall behind in this kind of market?\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/06/berkshire-hathaway-is-on-track-to-lag-behind-the-sp-500-in-buffetts-last-year-as-ceo.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "content": "Google - not AMD - is Nvidia’s greatest threat because of their full-stack AI and AlphaEvolve\n\nAMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else, but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company’s conception. Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000: \n\n\"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we had the ultimate search engine, it would understand everything on the web; it would understand, um, you know, exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. And that's obviously artificial intelligence.\"[ Google Co-Founder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI (2000)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OT_Uj2z3Z0) \\- For those that don’t know, it was supposedly Larry Page’s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI.\n\n# Full-stack AI\n\nNow, imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation. Your first thought will probably be: Which should I pick? ChatGPT immediately comes to mind, but you want to do your research properly. Through your research, you find that Google's Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck, at least among American AI models. Plus, they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model. Perfect. Google seems like a good choice. Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity (especially if they improve).\n\nBut what about implementation? Google offers enterprise-ready API:s via Vertex with more features coming like auth, database and payments, Google Cloud for storage, and now even at location TPU:s that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible. Super. Suddenly, your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google, and along the way, you never touch an Nvidia product.\n\nBut before you make your final decision, you ask yourself: Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term, so I don’t get vendor-locked with an inferior offering?\n\nI’ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never want to bet against the man - and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way. I don’t imagine Nvidia is particularly - or really at all - threatened by Google in the short term, though Google's TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices, reducing profit margin. Apparently, OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it, according to[ Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1994468652716859394), worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia. Though what is actually important is not the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future.\n\n# AlphaEvolve\n\nI allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed[ AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/). The evolutionary AI system had, in secret, improved everything from the training of their AI models to Google's hardware, i.e., their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multi-billion dollar deal for them, with Meta considering the same. \n\nThe remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro, not even Gemini 2.5. Today, it’s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations, and in the future, it will use far more powerful models than that. Meaning that the better Google’s AI models get, the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google’s models and hardware. The cheaper and better Google’s hardware, the more powerful models can be built and run. The more powerful the models, the better the hardware. And so on.\n\nBetter AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia’s CUDA moat. One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code, causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA. But once AI models become sufficiently advanced, the programming difficulty may not be a concern, or Google and Gemini create some CUDA-variant of their own. Rumors also exist of them doing just that.\n\n# All in all\n\nThis means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business, it’s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia. If they do it often enough, AI labs will eventually wonder: can you build better AI models without Nvidia? This will be especially true if other AI-labs do it too:[ “resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs”](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/tpuv7-google-takes-a-swing-at-the).\n\nDoes this mean I think Nvidia is done for? Not at all, as I said, I've spent enough time studying Jensen that I'd never want to bet against him. After all, he is a man who roommated with a 17-year-old ex-con covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5-trillion-dollar man. Jensen has a ton of cards to play, and he’s already playing them perfectly.\n\nNvidia still has a hardware/hardware-software lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future. If they make a substantial compute leap, Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia’s AI lab, absorb one of the AI labs, or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race. He is securing long-term deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia. Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development. He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem. Nvidia will likely begin to offer full-stack solutions of its own. And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia, Google and AMD.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I hold a significant long position in Google (Alphabet). The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not constitute financial or investment advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.  \n  \n**TLDR;** Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term, though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin. But over the long term, Google’s full stack offerings - AI models/applications, cloud and TPUs - with AI model’s designed to improve AI models and hardware (AlphaEvolve) getting better, Google might even take a long term lead. Though, Jensen is playing Nvidia’s cards perfectly. ",

Elon Musk has said before that he’s open to taking SpaceX public at some point, even though he’s also talked about the downsides of being a public company.

The other 2 RAM companies, Samsung an SK Hyinx will also profit as a whole 1/3rd of their competition in the consumer RAM market disappears completely. The AI Bubble popping would be because AI companies can’t meet expectations, thus not making profits, causing the bubble to pop, or the market crash. But these RAM providers ARE meeting expectations by selling the hardware. If the crash occurs, how would their stocks drop, if they are making profits by selling hardware?\n\nNote: I’m a fairly new investor, so I may be way off the mark with this evaluation.

Same company, wildly different conclusions.\n\nThe inputs matter so much more than the model. What growth rate? What discount rate? Terminal value? Change any slightly and your output swings massively.\n\nStarted using multiple methods and only getting interested when they converge. If DCF says one thing but Graham number says another I get skeptical.

      "content": "Puts vs. inverse ETFs? A one year update on MSTR\n\nA year ago on Saturday, December 7, 2024, [I joined the chorus of skeptics in calling bullshit on MSTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h8me2c/best_way_to_establish_a_short_position_on_mstr/), which had closed the previous Friday (December 6, 2024) at 395.01. As I was 100% convinced it would go down, I wanted to figure how to establish a bearish position. Unfortunately, as a long-only investor, I had no experience in doing this, so I thought asked this subreddit how best to achieve this exposure.\n\n* Most of the posters called me crazy.\n* Some agreed with my thesis but advised me not to pursue this: they were right.\n* Some thought MSTR would continue to moon.\n* Some suggested inverse ETFs.\n* Some suggested puts.\n\nUltimately, I decided to sit this out. However, so that I could be prepared the next time an opportunity presented itself, I decided to follow the outcomes of various strategies I would have considered.\n\nAs you probably know, being bearish on a stock not only requires that you are directionally correct, but that you are on point with the timing as well because you otherwise get gaped by exorbitant interest (with shorts), volatility decay (with inverse ETFs), or theta decay (with options). To make sure I didn't cherry pick the perfect time points, I chose **exactly one year** (12/7/24 to 12/6/25) for each of these securities. For the put options, I chose one- and two-year January dated expirations with round numbers (all initial prices adjusted for reverse splits). Note that the specific options denoted in asterisk have extremely low volumes:\n\n|Ticker|Strategy|Position|Initial|Current|% Change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[MSTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR/)|Underlying Stock|Long|395.01|178.99|(-54.69%)|\n|[MSTZ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTZ/)|2x Inverse ETF|Short|19.06|13.02|(-31.69%)|\n|[SMST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SMST/)|2x Inverse ETF|Short|113.00|71.24|(-36.96%)|\n|[MSTR260116P00300000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR260116P00300000/)|Jan 2026 300p|Short|104.02|121.27|\\+16.58%|\n|[MSTR260116P00250000\\*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR260116P00250000/)|Jan 2026 250p|Short|74.30|72.81|(-2.01%)|\n|[MSTR260116P00200000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR260116P00200000/)|Jan 2026 200p|Short|49.65|30.71|(-38.15%)|\n|[MSTR270115P00300000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR270115P00300000/)|Jan 2027 300p|Short|132.00|144.05|\\+9.13%|\n|[MSTR270115P00250000\\*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR270115P00250000/)|Jan 2027 250p|Short|98.80|100.00|\\+1.21%|\n|[MSTR270115P00200000\\*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR270115P00200000/)|Jan 2027 200p|Short|69.09|67.20|(-2.74%)|\n\nAs you can see, I was **spectacularly right** that the price of MSTR would plummet. MSTR bagholders have had a miserable time (-55%). However, I would have also lost about 1/3 of my principle with inverse ETFs MSTZ or SMST, as they naturally \"sell low\" and \"buy high\" (the basis of their volatility decay).\n\nNote that even though MSTR has fallen below the strike price for all the options, the less initially OTM put options (300p) would have been positive whereas the 200p would have been in the red.\n\n**\"Why don't you short it?\"**\n\nIn the end, it pretty much never makes sense to short a stock, even one that is completely garbage. You get an average of 11% per year with much less risk just for indexing (which requires no conviction), &gt;20% in recent years. If you really have the ability to generate alpha--as one must suppose to justify a short position--you can presumably get much higher than &gt;20% annual returns.",

      "content": "Russia's Oil Revenue, India as a buyer, and US leverage\n\nHi redditors, I came across an article called *The Geometry of Dependency* that sketches how energy flows are quietly rewriting the map of power. It looks at Russia selling cut-rate oil to India, India using that discount to hedge its future, and the United States trying to keep its weight in the system through sanctions and trade pressure. You see the outlines of a world where energy isn’t just fuel but a way of shaping how states move, who they rely on, and how far their autonomy can stretch.\n\nCurious what you think: are we watching the early shape of new alliances forming, or is this just another cycle in a system that ultimately bends back toward U.S. influence?",

Megadeals can help the platform, but there is no track record in recent history that it helps the stock.\n\nNetflix is facing a similar dynamic.\n\nExpect 12 - 18 months of purgatory as they close the deal through regulatory scrutiny.

      "title": "Visa Inc - Not just a Credit Card network, It's a hyperscaler (Complete Understanding of the Visa's business model)",
      "content": "Visa Inc - Not just a Credit Card network, It's a hyperscaler (Complete Understanding of the Visa's business model)\n\nThrough this post, I will try to make you understand the business model of Visa Inc and how dominant it is in the payments network and the finance industry. Visa is not just a credit card network now. When you take up the recent earnings calls of Visa, they claim themselves as a \"Hyperscaler\".\n\nIn the general technology sector, a \"Hyperscaler\" refers to massive cloud service providers (like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud) that possess vast computing infrastructure. They allow other companies to build software on top of their servers so those companies don't have to build their own data centers.\n\nHow is Visa a Hyperscaler here? In this text, Visa is co-opting this term to describe their role in the financial ecosystem.\n\nInfrastructure - Instead of servers, Visa provides the \"rails\" for money movement (processing 258 billion transactions).\n\nScalability - Just as a startup uses AWS to scale instantly, a fintech or bank can use Visa to instantly access 12 billion endpoints (cards, accounts, wallets) without building the connections themselves.\n\nThe \"Platform\" Play - Visa is saying, \"We provide the infrastructure (the stack); you build the specific payment business (the app) on top of us.\"\n\nTherefore, Visa divides their platform into multiple layers - 1. Foundation layer, 2. Services layer, and lastly the 3. Solutions layer. This is their core business.\n\nStarting with Foundation layer, under this layer they provide their infrastructure to the customers. This infrastructure handles the raw connectivity and processing. A core payment infrastructure others plug in to build businesses. Anyone building Fintech, Wallets, cards, payouts, super-apps etc., builds on Visa instead of building their own rails. Why? Visa directly provides you the access to the global payments network, you just cannot replicate it overnight yourself. It's like becoming the operating system of money movement. How do they make money here? For this layer they make money by acting like a toll booth, as the transactions pass through their network (payments network), they not only charge some fees for moving these transactions, banks and other players also pay fees to stay in the network as per volume and usage. For anyone to replicate this infrastructure (where Visa has licenses and approval from 200 countries, Multi-currency engine, block chain technology and 12 billion end-points) would require years of lobbying, legal work and investments.\n\nSecond layer is the Services layer. Under this layer, they make tools for clients, for them to obtain these tools on rent as per their preferences. Under this layer they provide Identity &amp; Security, fraud detection and scam prevention and Risk Management tools and the clients can choose to rent whatever the tools they are in need. This layer significantly increases the TAM of the company, so that they are not only depended on the transaction fees and credit card fees, but they are also increasing adjacent sources of revenues. By Visa tokens, merchants are given unique token numbers rather than 16-digit credit card number, so that the credit card number is not exposed to threat and no risk of data leakage. Next Visa AI sees everything. That is it is scanning the global payments network constantly and if it founds anomalies in the payments network, it freezes the merchant and informs the law enforcement (This point may sound slightly vague, cuz I'm not putting in a detailed way. But the AI tries to find any anomalies in the payments network, like how classic scams take place and accordingly acts on the situation). Banks and institutions place high trust on Visa and Visa provides its scam prevention and fraud detection services. It's almost like an insurance for Banks - they pay millions today happily to avoid billions of losses and also data leakage. Then under this layer, Visa is also able to get the data regarding consumer trends and spending, which they sell to the companies to analyze these trends (obviously not the card details and personal details, rather what the consumers are buying, what are the trends and preferences etc.). Therefore by selling these security services, they earn money under this layer.\n\nNext comes their solutions layer. These are pre-built solutions that are used by merchants, banks and consumers. This layer consists of the Consumer payments (credit cards etc.), Commercial solutions and Value-added services. Their Visa Pay acts like a global adapter that connects even the shortest of end point (say a vegetable or a juice vendor) to the global payments vendor - which is the moat provided by their infrastructure layer. Next their \"Visa Flex\", under which they enable the customers to use one single card like a debit or credit or loyalty points. Just by using the banking app, Visa provides you a switch, which you can toggle to use the same card like a credit card or debit card or loyalty points. Next comes their commercial solutions, which has become highly important in the ecosystem. Commercial solutions are for B2B transactions. Businesses can't rely on traditional methods to process payments, so they instantly generate \"virtual visa card\" for a specific transaction and transfer it to each other (for ex - Expedia doing business with any hotel). This way it is faster, safer and easier.\n\nThis shows, how strong of a moat Visa has. And we already know, both Visa and Mastercard together have a duopoly in the payments network. However there is one significant risk that people should look at for both Visa and Mastercard. When you read Visa's annual report (especially for the period ending 30 sep 2025) you will find the \"Interchange multidistrict litigation\". This litigation, known formally as *In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation (MDL 1720)*, began in **2005**. It is a massive class-action lawsuit filed by U.S. merchants (retailers, gas stations, convenience stores) against Visa, Mastercard, and the major banks that issue credit cards (like JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Bank of America).\n\nThe Allegations - Merchants claimed that Visa and Mastercard violated antitrust laws in two ways:\n\nPrice Fixing - They allegedly conspired to set \"interchange fees\" (swipe fees) at artificially high levels. These are the fees merchants pay to banks every time you swipe a card (typically 1-3%).\n\nAnti-Competitive Rules - They imposed rules that prevented merchants from steering customers toward cheaper payment methods (e.g., banning a merchant from saying, \"We prefer cash or debit because it costs us less\").\n\nThe liability for this litigation is ring-fenced to the Class B shareholders (the banks). If Visa pays a $2B fine, the Class B conversion ratio drops, and the banks eat the loss. Your Class A shares are shielded from the direct cost, though you are still exposed to the indirect risk of regulatory changes hurting Visa's future growth.\n\nThe lawsuit isn't settling because the plaintiffs (merchants) don't just want money they want freedom. They want the freedom to steer customers away from expensive cardsand the freedom to negotiate fees in a free market. Visa and Mastercard cannot agree to that without dismantling the business model that makes them the most profitable companies in the world. Until one side capitulates on the structure of the market, the litigation continues. Overall, this risk is worth looking into, before any decision.\n\nLastly, when we talk valuation, looking at EV-FCF, the lowest EV-FCF Visa ever had in the last 10 years was 21. Currently it is around 29. Therefore around EV-FCF of 23, it would be a fine \"buy and hold\" type buy. Looking at the strong moats and \"Duopoly\" status, I think this business deserves premium multiples.\n\nSo these were my thoughts on Visa, you can share yours too here. Thank you!!!\n\n",

Out of the 12 voting members on the FOMC, five have openly pushed back against further easing, while three members of the Board of Governors are in favor of cutting rates. Markets are still largely expecting a cut, but this level of internal disagreement raises big questions about what Jerome Powell might signal going forward. Even if a cut happens, the language around future policy could matter just as much as the decision itself. Feels like one of those meetings where the statement and press conference could move markets more than the actual rate decision.\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-st-week-ahead-feds-internal-split-puts-spotlight-powells-rate-guidance-2025-12-05/](https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-st-week-ahead-feds-internal-split-puts-spotlight-powells-rate-guidance-2025-12-05/)",

MARKET SENTIMENT: **Bearish with Retail Distress**  \n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Dominated by negative themes—job cuts (Tyson, US/Canada labor data), retail trading losses (\"-75k over 5 years\"), and skepticism (CVNA S&P addition mocked). GameStop ($GME) chatter shows speculative retail interest but is isolated.  \n- **Macro Data:** Elevated unemployment (4.4%), high 10Y yield (4.11%), and moderate VIX (15.78) suggest cautious to negative bias.  \n- **Market Snapshot:** Mixed but weak—SOXS (bearish semiconductor ETF) down, NVDA slightly down, though IRBT and WBD show rallies on low volume.  \n- **Overall:** Bearish sentiment driven by labor market concerns, retail frustration, and defensive positioning.\n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES  \n**A. Labor Market Deterioration**  \n- Reddit: Tyson layoffs, US job cuts surging 183% in October, Canada’s job gains contrast.  \n- Macro: Unemployment at 4.4% supports softening labor narrative.  \n\n**B. Retail Speculation & Meme Stock Resurgence**  \n- Reddit: $GME earnings anticipation, hedge fund shorting theories, CVNA S&P inclusion mocked.  \n- FMP Data: Low-volume moves in stocks like IRBT (+21.98%) align with retail-driven volatility.  \n\n**C. Geopolitical & Sectoral Shifts**  \n- Reddit: China’s growing scientific clout, SpaceX valuation talks ($800B).  \n- RSS News: Bloomberg coverage of China, Nepal Gen-Z uprising, AI stocks (Yahoo Finance).  \n\n**D. Valuation & Tax Pressures**  \n- Reddit: Millionaire tax in Massachusetts ($5.7B haul).  \n- RSS: Advent International dumping $153M in First Watch stock signals potential overvaluation concerns.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Catalysts:**  \n- **$GME Earnings (Next Week):** Could trigger meme-stock volatility; Reddit speculation indicates retail positioning.  \n- **Job Data:** October surge in cuts (153K) may pressure consumer discretionary stocks.  \n- **IPO Activity:** ICICI Prudential AMC $1.2B IPO (Dec 12) may test risk appetite.  \n\n**Technical Signals:**  \n- **VIX at 15.78:** Moderate fear, but not extreme.  \n- **10Y Yield at 4.11%:** Restrictive for growth equities.  \n- **Gold (GLD) at 386.44:** Slight safe-haven demand.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Labor Market Slowdown:** Rising job cuts could weaken consumer spending, affecting retail and discretionary sectors.  \n2. **Retail Overconcentration:** Meme-stock speculation ($GME, CVNA) increases volatility risk for unprepared traders.  \n3. **Valuation Pressures:** High yields compress equity valuations; large institutional sales (e.g., Advent International) signal caution.  \n4. **Geopolitical Shifts:** US-China competition (scientific influence) may impact tech and supply chain sectors.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Defensive Positioning:** Utilities, consumer staples may benefit from risk-off sentiment.  \n2. **AI & Tech Resilience:** Yahoo Finance highlights AI stocks as potential buys; NVDA dip (-0.53%) could be entry point for long-term investors.  \n3. **Short-Term Volatility Plays:** Elevated VIX and meme-stock activity offer options trading opportunities.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**For Traders/Investors:**  \n\n**SECTOR: Consumer Discretionary** – **Caution** due to job cut headlines and potential spending pullback. Monitor $AMZN, $HD for weakness.  \n\n**SECTOR: Technology** – **Selective Opportunities**. AI stocks (e.g., $NVDA, $AMD) may be oversold; watch for institutional accumulation.  \n\n**SYMBOL: $GME** – **High Risk/High Reward**. Earnings next week could spark short squeeze or sharp decline. Retail sentiment is bullish, but fundamentals remain weak. Use tight stops.  \n\n**SYMBOL: $CVNA** – **Avoid/Skepticism**. Mocked on Reddit after S&P addition; potential for sentiment-driven sell-off.  \n\n**SYMBOL: $IRBT** – **Speculative Momentum**. +21.98% on low volume suggests retail pump; consider profit-taking if holding.  \n\n**MACRO: Watch Labor Data** – Next US jobs report critical for Fed policy path. A higher unemployment rate could accelerate rate-cut bets, boosting bonds ($TLT) and tech.  \n\n**STRATEGY: Hedge Equity Exposure** – Consider long $SOXS (bearish semiconductor ETF) or $SQQQ (bearish Nasdaq) as short-term hedges if market weakness persists.  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** The market shows bearish retail sentiment amid labor market deterioration, with pockets of speculative frenzy ($GME). Focus on defensive sectors, selective tech, and prepare for volatility around $GME earnings. Monitor job data for macro direction.  \n\n**Risk Level:** High (Retail-driven volatility, weakening labor market).",

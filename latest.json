      "content": "Oracle +5% after hours after TikTok signs binding US joint venture with Oracle taking 15% stake\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-says-signed-agreements-create-222642566.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-says-signed-agreements-create-222642566.html)\n\n&gt;TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew told employees that the social media company and its parent, ByteDance Ltd., signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture majority-owned by American investors\n\n&gt;In an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Chew said he was “pleased to share some great news” and said agreements with Oracle Corp., Silver Lake and MGX have been signed. Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22, 2026.\n\n&gt;“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” Chew said in the memo. Meanwhile, “TikTok global’s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing,” he wrote.\n\n&gt;The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September, which was pending approval from China. Chew’s memo does not mention China’s opinion on the transaction. It says 50% of the investors will be new, with Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment company, retaining 15% each; 30.1% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance.\n\n&gt;After more than a year of negotiations, Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance’s popular video app to a consortium of investors. If finalized, the deal would remove a persistent issue in Beijing-Washington relations and signal progress in broader talks. But it would also deprive China’s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon.\n\n&gt;ByteDance’s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok’s business. Under the the deal proposed by Washington, ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity, which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle, TikTok’s cloud partner.\n\n&gt;Trump’s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know?: QuickTake\n\n&gt;The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement, which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration. US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app’s recommendation algorithm.\n\n&gt;Under the law, the initial deadline for the sell-or-ban rule was this past January, but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office, most recently pushing it into January 2026.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bes8jzkrv18g1.png?width=1587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f406b925304f2c0ce50176783172b3016adb28fc\n\n",

      "content": "Vitalik Buterin Warns Elon Musk That X's Hate Campaigns Could Hurt Free Speech\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed issues to Elon Musk, arguing that the recent surge of \"unhinged\" hate speech and coordinated attacks against Europe on X (formerly Twitter) is jeopardizing the very future of free speech. Following a €120 million fine imposed on X by the European Commission for Digital Services Act violations—including issues with the paid verification system and lack of transparency—Buterin observed that discourse on the platform has shifted from policy debate to \"emotionally-manipulative misinformation.\"\n\nButerin expressed concern that Musk has turned the platform into a \"death star laser for coordinated hate sessions,\" specifically targeting European cities like London and delegitizing the EU. He argues that this behavior risks a massive global backlash against liberal values in the coming years. While acknowledging valid criticisms of EU bureaucracy and surveillance, Buterin maintains that X’s current trajectory—where algorithms are \"arbitrarily\" tweaked to boost rage over civility—is a structural risk to democratic values.\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin proposed two primary solutions:\n\n* Algorithmic Transparency: Disclosing optimization targets so users understand what the platform is promoting and why.\n* On-Chain Verification: Using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and time-stamping decisions on-chain to make the algorithm more transparent and less susceptible to manual manipulation or censorship.\n\nUltimately, Buterin views the survival of a unified, reformed Europe as a vital global model and fears that Musk’s \"personal vendetta\" against EU regulators is weaponizing the platform in a way that will eventually lead to the destruction of the free speech principles Musk claims to defend.",

      "title": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector",
      "content": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector\n\nA few weeks ago I saw an interesting post here about the [energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pbgprq/energy_stocks_are_still_cheap_and_nobody_seems_to/) sector. The basic idea was straightforward:\n\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data center capacity planned over the next five years, and data centers are extreme power consumers. In the U.S., a large share of power generation still comes from hydrocarbons, especially natural gas. Companies that provide that energy appear to be overlooked.\n\nWhat that post didn’t get into was a deeper dive into the energy companies themselves — specifically, which ones might actually offer attractive opportunities today.\n\nSo I decided to do that. I used a tool I built that ingests SEC filings for each company and supplements them with industry data from:\n\n* American Petroleum Institute\n* U.S. Energy Information Administration\n* American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers\n* Society of Petroleum Engineers\n* Journal of Petroleum Technology\n* World Oil\n* Oil and Gas Journal\n* Hydrocarbon Processing\n\nI produced 10+ reports across different energy companies. After going through all of them, the companies that stood out to me were:\n\n* [Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/BjArBLK0WHRj) – this was the most interesting to me given that it generated \\~$8.1B of TTM free cash flow in 2024 on a \\~$73B market cap (a mid-teens FCF yield if sustained), while the stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months (+0.9%). It trades at \\~7x EV/EBITDA and \\~12x TTM EPS, despite controlling \\~20.1B boe of long-life 2P oil sands reserves and producing \\~1.36M boe/d. The valuation appears to reflect market skepticism around long-duration durability and Canadian policy risk more than near-term cash generation.\n* [Matador Resources (MTDR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/eXS9JPBjEbOK) – MTDR stood out because balance-sheet stress is not evident in the current numbers: net debt sits below \\~1x EBITDA, production continues to grow in the Delaware Basin, and the company owns majority-interest, largely fee-based midstream assets (San Mateo / Pronto) that support cash-flow stability. Despite this, the stock trades around \\~3x EV/EBITDA, a multiple more commonly associated with higher leverage or structurally challenged E&amp;Ps.\n* [Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/YDjQ0bF0lQjM) – In contrast to the commodity-exposed producers, EPD’s appeal is the consistency of its cash generation: operating cash flow has stayed above \\~$7.5B annually since 2021, distribution coverage has run \\~1.6–1.7x, and the partnership retained \\~$3.24B in 2024 after distributions. Units trade around \\~7.5x EV/EBITDA despite this level of cash-flow stability and balance-sheet strength.\n\nI’m also sharing the reports for the other companies I analyzed in case anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [CHEVRON CORP (CVX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/dPtgVsyaOVZt)\n* [ANTERO RESOURCES Corp (AR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/IDhlgnNAdAUB)\n* [AEMETIS, INC (AMTX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/qWCT1bsvIyDj)\n* [NextDecade Corp (NEXT)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/JJZlaAD3JrFK)\n* [AMEREN CORP (AEE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/bz6cvzIIw5KP)\n* [SM Energy Co (SM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/2rQK36fGNwaD)\n* [Crescent Energy Co (CRGY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/DDSGWbDUlote)\n* [EXXON MOBIL CORP (XOM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/p9Lzg0rb1qKZ)\n* [OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP (OXY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/8ZSEPD2k7oDk)\n* [Vital Energy, Inc. (VTLE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/sYfs8N4YJHVR)\n* [WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. (WMB)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/z2j2kNtxUEXR)\n\nCusious to hear which energy stocks others here are following. Any interesting ones I missed?",

The question is: Is this 40% surge the start of a new rally, or are old players looking for buyers at these high levels?\n\nI'm a bit conflicted myself:\n\nOn one hand, you can never underestimate the “madness” of this stock using traditional logic;\n\nOn the other hand, chasing it at these levels easily turns you into the “last one holding the bag.”\n\nSo I'd love to hear your thoughts\n\nDo you see any worthwhile opportunities here?\n\nIs this a short term bet, an event driven play, or have you completely written off stocks like this?",

Buffett will be particularly missed at a time when many of the most successful people in the business community seem single-mindedly focused on making money, without reflecting much on the way they make it or what they will do with it. Just because you *can* doesn’t mean you *should*.\n\nMakes me a little sad that I got interested in this topic this year, at the tail of end Buffett's career. \n\n",

      "content": "Will memory chip prices continue to skyrocket?\n\nMicron's earnings report showed strong demand for memory chips, easing investor concerns about a potential slowdown in data center construction. Micron Technology's adjusted revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $13.64 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations of $12.95 billion; adjusted net profit was $5.482 billion, compared to $3.469 billion in the same period last year. The company projected second-quarter revenue of $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion, significantly higher than the market expectation of $14.3 billion. Morgan Stanley analysts stated that, besides Nvidia, this might be the largest upward revision of revenue and net profit guidance in the history of the US semiconductor industry.\n\nKey data at a glance: Not only did the first-quarter performance exceed expectations, but the second-quarter revenue guidance was even higher, at $18.7 billion ± $400 million, a full $4 billion more than the market estimate of $14.38 billion! This data is not isolated, but rather a \"charge signal\" for the full recovery of the memory chip industry.",

I've got my 401k and an emergency fund set, so now I'm looking to open a brokerage account for some growth oriented investing. I know trying to time the market is a fool's game, so I'm more interested in finding companies I believe in for the next few years.\n\nAll the hype seems to be about AI and semiconductors right now, and the prices reflect that. It feels a bit frothy. I'm trying to look past the current trends and think about what might be a good buy for 2026 and beyond. I keep seeing lists for the \"best growth stocks 2026\" but they all just seem to list the same mega cap tech companies.\n\nI'm not afraid of some risk, but I also don't want to just chase what's already shot up. I'm interested in sectors that might be overlooked now but have solid long term potential.\n\nHow do you even begin to research a company for a 3-5 year time horizon instead of just quarterly earnings?  \nAre there sectors you think are undervalued right now that could be strong contenders for the best growth stocks 2026?  \nHow much does current Fed policy and interest rates play into your long term stock picks?\n\nI'm not looking for specific tickers, more like a framework for how to think about this.

That seems fairly straightforward to analyze - what is the total payment volume, how is it growing, and what is the take rate. Okay. \n \nBut the other part of the financial arms is extending consumer credit. They extend loans to consumers, to buy things on the platform, and have to hold some provisions for losses for these. \n \nThis is more like a banking operation. But unlike a bank, you can’t really disentangle the lending operations from the e-commerce part of the business - since the credit is fuelling purchases on the platform. And you can’t really pull out the balance sheets of these operations to analyze for financial soundness. Finally, we don’t really have great historical analogues for consumer credit cycles in these emerging markets like Latin America and Southeast Asia. \n \nFor investors in these companies, how do you analyze the lending divisions of these companies?

Also Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and  the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders.\n\n Tesla’s SEC filings show that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market.\n\n Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution.\n\n Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards.\n\nTesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels.  Absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.\n\nThis is my follow up post to my previous post on the same space which got deleted bcoz I didn't do any detailed analysis.Here you have it",

      "content": "DaVita: you gotta be kidney-ing me\n\nI think the market has completely overblown the GLP 1 threat to DVA. While the headlines focus on falling obesity rates, there isnt evidence to show that real world kidney disease incidence is dropping. Perhaps the drugs cause too much muscle loss, or maybe people are just not staying on them long enough. Real-world data shows nearly 60% of users quit within a year, and obesity remains pervasive amonst Gen Z. \n\nDVA is trades at a forward P/E of 9.4, which is a significant discount to its historical 5 year average. When you consider they just authorized another $2 billion in buybacks, you’re looking at a company that is aggressively cannibalizing its own cheap shares.\n\n​The real long term story here is DaVita’s shift toward integrated kidney care and their massive international expansion. They’ve quietly built a footprint of over 580 centers in 14 countries, effectively diversifying away from U.S. regulatory risk and capturing growth in markets like Brazil and Japan where dialysis demand is booming.  They are also moving 100% of their centers to the Epic EHR platform to modernize billing and prevent caims lag that was seem after the April cyber incident. Plus, the pivot toward home dialysis (now 15% of their patient base) is a double win: it’s preferred by patients and significantly reduces the expensive nurse-to-patient labor ratios that have squeezed margins recently. With a trailing EBITDA of roughly $2.7 billion and a dominant market position, DVA isn't a dying business.\n\nAs the market pivots away from tech, I think now might be the right time to start buying into DVA. I see it as a premier, low beta, defense play providing a recession resistant business model. Sentiment surrounding this stock has been very negative creating an opportunity for us value-minded individuals.\n\nLet me know what you guys think.",

      "content": "Not overreacting to the NVDA insider sale\n\nNvidia director Harvey Jones sold about 250,000 shares around $177 for roughly $44M. These were shares he’s held for decades, and he still controls over 7M shares through a trust, so I read this as long term trimming more than a confidence signal turning negative. (News source if you’re interested: Nvidia Executives Sell Over $41 Million in Stock)For me, the headline only matters if it lines up with the chart. NVDA is in a pretty defined zone and the $177 to $180 area is the near term pivot. That’s roughly where the sale happened, and it has also been a tough area for the stock to push through lately. If NVDA can reclaim $180 and stay above it for a few closes, it’s basically the market saying it does not care about the insider headline.On the downside, I’m watching $169 to $171 as first support. If that breaks cleanly, the next likely stop is the mid $160s, around $165 to $160. Below that, you’re probably looking at the low $150s, and that usually needs a broader market wobble or a real shift in the AI narrative. This is also why I’m not overreacting to the insider sale by itself. Big, long held positions get trimmed all the time. Without a real break in price or a clear change in demand signals, it’s not enough for me to call a top.",

I mean the companies that produce the power, not the companies that buy it and sell it to consumers. \n\nFrom where I sit, Texas is the number one destination for these huge power hungry AI data centers.

Deadlines start slipping. A team that used to be fast suddenly moves slower.  \nBudgets stretch further than expected. Meetings multiply without producing decisions. Leaders start sensing friction but theyre not sure where it’s coming from. Is it workload imbalance?  A manager overwhelmed? A team operating without clarity? Resources being allocated the wrong way? Or something deeper, like burnout creeping through an entire department? The truth is inefficiency rarely announces itself. It builds quietly, hidden inside tools, systems, and processes that no one has time to examine. By the time the symptoms are loud enough for executives to notice, the problem has already become expensive. HR is expected to diagnose these issues yet theyre asked to do it without the one thing that would make it possible: connected, clear data. You cant fix what you cant see and most inefficiencies stay invisible far longer than they should and HR AI solutions are needed!!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-18 21:32:12 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral-to-Cautiously Bullish**\n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Mixed. Retail traders show optimism around specific catalysts (Trump Media merger, GME nostalgia, positive CPI print) but underlying skepticism persists (CPI data disbelief, personal loss stories). The tone is speculative and event-driven, not broadly confident.\n- **Macro Backdrop:** Supportive. US CPI at 2.7% (down from 3.0%) suggests continued disinflation, potentially keeping the Fed on hold. Equity Risk Premium of 4.33% remains attractive vs. 10Y yield of 4.16%. VIX at 17.62 indicates moderate, not fearful, volatility.\n- **Global Crosscurrents:** The Bank of Japan's historic rate hike introduces volatility and yen weakness, which may support US equities via a weaker JPY/USD and capital flows. China's structural shifts and record ETF inflows signal targeted optimism in Chinese equities despite broader economic concerns.\n- **Conclusion:** The macro foundation (cooling inflation, stable rates) is mildly bullish, but retail sentiment is fragmented and reactive. Institutional flows (per news) appear more disciplined, focusing on specific regions/sectors.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES\n- **Inflation Narrative Dominance:** CPI data (2.7%) is a top discussion point on Reddit and a key macro input. Skepticism about data authenticity contrasts with its market-positive interpretation.\n- **Central Bank Policy Divergence:** BOJ's aggressive hike (highest since 1995) and Japan's 10Y yield hitting 2% (first since 2006) signal a major regime shift, impacting global bond markets and currency flows.\n- **Meme Stock & Retail Speculation Revival:** Trump Media ($DJT) merger news (+25%), GameStop ($GME) references, and \"ape historian\" posts indicate renewed retail interest in high-volatility, narrative-driven stocks.\n- **Geopolitical & Trade Policy:** Trump tariff discussions resurface, linking to potential future manufacturing and trade deficit impacts—a theme for 2025 policy uncertainty.\n- **Commodity Volatility:** Nickel rebounding on Indonesia supply cuts, Chinese coking coal surging—highlighting supply-side inflationary pressures in industrial materials.\n- **Sector-Specific Weakness:** Nike's China/Converse struggles and Apple buyback criticism point to consumer discretionary headwinds and shareholder return debates.\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n- **Immediate Catalysts:**\n    1. **$DJT Merger:** Trump Media's $6B merger with TAE Technologies (fusion energy) is sparking a retail-driven rally—watch for volatility and potential spillover into other \"Trump-trade\" or speculative SPACs.\n    2. **BOJ Policy Shift:** A sustained rise in JGB yields could pressure global bond markets and strengthen the USD vs. JPY, benefiting US multinational earnings but tightening financial conditions.\n    3. **US CPI Print (2.7%):** Confirms disinflation trend, reducing near-term Fed hike risks. However, Reddit skepticism may reflect broader distrust that could limit bullish momentum.\n- **Technical Signals:**\n    - **$NVDA** up 1.87%—leadership in tech remains intact.\n    - **$SOXS** (3x short semiconductor ETF) down -7.45%—indicates strong bullish sentiment in semis.\n    - **$UGRO** up 18.61%—micro-cap volatility, possibly retail-driven.\n- **Flow Signals:**\n    - Record inflows into China A500 ETFs suggest smart money positioning for a policy-driven rebound.\n    - India's financial reforms targeting foreign capital indicate emerging market rotation opportunities.\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n- **Primary Risks:**\n    1. **Retail Overexuberance:** Concentrated speculation in $DJT, $GME-related assets could lead to sharp reversals if narratives fade.\n    2. **Global Policy Spillover:** BOJ's abrupt tightening could trigger volatility in global rates and currency markets, impacting risk assets.\n    3. **China Slowdown:** Nike's China slump and economic shift articles highlight persistent demand weakness, affecting multinationals and commodities.\n    4. **Inflation Data Credibility:** Public skepticism (per Reddit) may undermine confidence in official data, increasing volatility around future releases.\n- **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1. **Disinflation Trade:** With CPI trending down, quality growth stocks and duration-sensitive assets (tech, utilities) may benefit from stable rates.\n    2. **Japan Normalization Plays:** Long USD/JPY, short JGBs, or Japanese financial stocks could benefit from BOJ's new trajectory.\n    3. **Strategic Commodity Exposure:** Nickel and coking coal supply constraints offer selective opportunities in materials/metals.\n    4. **India/China Dichotomy:** India reforms vs. China stagnation may drive EM capital rotation—favor Indian equities over Chinese consumer discretionary.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n- **SECTOR: Semiconductors** – Strong price action ($NVDA, $SOXS down) suggests continued institutional confidence. Favor large-cap semis over broad tech.\n- **SYMBOL: $DJT** – High-risk, high-reward speculative play. Retail momentum is strong post-merger news, but fundamental valuation is extreme. Trade with strict risk management; avoid long-term holds.\n- **SECTOR: Japanese Financials** – Beneficiaries of BOJ rate hikes and steepening yield curve. Consider ETFs like $DXJ or direct exposure to major banks.\n- **SYMBOL: $GLD** – Gold at $398.57 may face headwinds if real rates rise (BOJ impact), but geopolitical and data-credibility risks provide support. Neutral near-term; wait for clearer trend.\n- **SECTOR: Industrial Metals** – Nickel and coking coal supply cuts support prices. Consider producers or ETFs like $JJN (nickel) for tactical exposure.\n- **SYMBOL: $BBAI** – Up 3.49% with elevated attention; micro-cap AI/tech names are seeing retail interest. High volatility; suitable only for aggressive traders.\n- **MACRO: Monitor USD/JPY** – Key pair reflecting BOJ vs. Fed policy divergence. Break above 155 could signal extended USD strength, impacting US equity valuations.\n- **WATCH: China A500 ETF Flows** – Sustained inflows may signal a tactical bottom in Chinese equities, particularly policy-supported sectors.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is balancing positive US disinflation against BOJ-driven global volatility. Retail is chasing speculative mergers and meme stocks, while institutions are repositioning in Japan and selective commodities. Favor semiconductors, Japanese financials, and industrial metals tactically, but maintain hedges against sudden sentiment shifts in speculative retail favorites.",

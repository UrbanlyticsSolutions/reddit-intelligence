This block carried a base reward of about 3.125 BTC (following the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced mining subsidies), plus additional transaction fees that pushed the total payout slightly higher.

      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

The question is: Is this 40% surge the start of a new rally, or are old players looking for buyers at these high levels?\n\nI'm a bit conflicted myself:\n\nOn one hand, you can never underestimate the “madness” of this stock using traditional logic;\n\nOn the other hand, chasing it at these levels easily turns you into the “last one holding the bag.”\n\nSo I'd love to hear your thoughts\n\nDo you see any worthwhile opportunities here?\n\nIs this a short term bet, an event driven play, or have you completely written off stocks like this?",

Just sit it out like Buffett or just put some money in the S&amp;P 500 and that's it. Save it for \"good times\" which are the opposite for \"normal\" investors.\n\n**\"This stock went up 700%, is this stock good?\"**\n\nIf the only value you see is that the stock went up by 700%+, that's not value investing...\n\n**\"Should I buy Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, XYZ?\"**\n\nWhat about you do your own DD and stay in your area of competence. If you don't know why a stock went up, you won't understand why it goes down...\n\nYou should know when a company is undervalued and when it's overpriced.\n\n**\"I bought a stock one month ago, it went down 5%, should I sell?\"**\n\nIf you truly did your DD and you are a value investor, you just sit it out. You have time; you bought to hold it for years. I have stocks in my portfolio for over 10 years...\n\nI could go on and on and on, like trimming your portfolio every month, just looking at the numbers and not understanding the company, etc., etc., etc.!\n\n  \n**\"This stock dipped 30% everybody all in\"** \n\nI heard this story 100s times, I always ask, what makes you believe that it will go up again ? If you dont have a good answer dont buy! \n\n  \n\n\nIt's not that difficult to be a value investor. All you need is:\n\n**Benjamin Graham - The Intelligent Investor**\n\nMake sure you truly understand it, I needed time to understand it fully! If you are too lazy to read one book, you probably don't have the discipline to be a value investor.\n\nBonus: If this book is to \"difficult\" (no shame in that, I started very very slow) start with Peter Lynch + Youtube New Money.\n\nMost of you have the knowledge but some here either dont understand Valueinvesting or simply dont have the dispcpline and try to chase quick returns.\n\nEverything I do isnt based on my \"opinion\" or community posts its based on the tools of people who 100x smarter than me like Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham etc.\n\nWith these tools I try to find \"gaps\" in the marked and thats it. Sometimes it takes years sometimes only month. I have time!",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

Broadcom’s debt is far larger than AMD's. \nAMD's goal is to gain market share from Nvidia. But Google's TPU performance shows that big techs can rely on their own custom chips rather than buying from Nvidia or AMD.  Therefore, I am guessing big techs will use more and more of their own custom chips in future. Considering those facts, would it be a good idea to buy Broadcom by selling all of AMD's shares? ",

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions.

      "content": "are there any power ETF's that only hold Texas based power production companies?\n\nIs there an ETF that holds only Texas power production companies and companies who produce power for sale in Texas?  I mean the companies that produce the power, not the companies that buy it and sell it to consumers. \n\nFrom where I sit, Texas is the number one destination for these huge power hungry AI data centers.  There are by my calculations exactly 0 new power plants being built, for the most part the power companies are focusing on making them more efficient or expanding some but shovels breaking ground on new is zero and its been zero since Biden passed the build back act.  \n\nIn my opinion there is a pretty clear reasons why none have gotten off the ground, they have long build times and there are countless ways that they can be derailed.  \n\nThe reason for Texas is that they have a unique power grid that allows for open market bidding on power and its not meaningfully connected to the eastern or western part of the US grid.    \n\nIf my thesis is correct that data centers will require a huge amount of power, can be put up very quickly, have vast resources to bid on the open market and no new power sources are coming online for at least 10 years, the premium that the producers of power in Texas will be able to charge is going to go up significantly.

Obviously FXAIX is an index fund and IVV is an ETF, but are there different tax stuff that I am missing? On Fidelity the expense ratio for FXAIX is half that of IVV... just not clear if/why FXAIX is superior to IVV for long-term investing. Anyone smarter than me able to help lol?",

      "content": "Clustered 10b5-1 plan adoptions at Wave Life Sciences, normal or notable?\n\nI’m looking for feedback from people who’ve looked at insider trading patterns before.\n\nWave Life Sciences (WVE) stock jumped \\~3x on December 8 following positive interim trial results. On that same day, 8 executives/directors executed stock sales under 10b5-1 plans. I understand the same-day execution is plausibly explained by price-based triggers or limit orders.\n\nHowever, I saw that the 8 plans that executed on December 8 were initiated in two clusters:\n\n* 3 plans on March 13, 2025\n* 5 plans on August 6, 2025\n\nI pulled Form 4 data for Wave from 2024–2025 to look closer at this pattern and wrote up the details here [https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/](https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/)\n\nMy question:  \nI'm relatively new to this. Is this kind of clustered 10b5-1 adoption and execution fairly typical in biotech or other industries? Is this easily explained by compensation cycles/normal planning, or is this something you’d flag as worth a second look? \n\nI haven't yet benchmarked against a larger sample of biotech companies, that's on my list if this is indeed notable.",

      "content": "Is enhanced direct indexing the right choice for me?\n\nBackground: over a decade ago I invested a sizeable chunk of my savings into a big tech company that has done well over the intervening years. Now I find myself in a position where a large percentage of my portfolio is in this single security and I'm looking to diversify.\n\nI have been told that enhanced direct indexing is a good option for unwinding a concentrated position. I'm a novice here but if I understand it correctly, for a non-trivial fee, a management firm will use my concentrated position as leverage to buy long and short positions and use tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains, effectively diversifying while deferring the large taxable event.\n\nAre there big inherent risks I'm not aware of? Are there other options I should consider? I recognize there's a real risk by having nearly half of my portfolio in a single security but I don't want to make a mistake and take an even greater risk trying to unwind it. \n\nThanks!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 09:32:05 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **BEARISH WITH HIGH VOLATILITY RISK**\n\nThe confluence of data points to a **cautious to bearish** short-term sentiment, dominated by macro fears and retail skepticism.\n\n*   **Reddit Sentiment (Retail Bias):** Overwhelmingly negative and skeptical. Top discussions highlight inflation data controversy, record \"quad witching\" volatility risk, soaring national debt, and generational economic tension. The tone is distrustful of official narratives (\"Extreme media fud,\" \"Economists Cry Foul\").\n*   **Macro & Technical Backdrop:** Supportive of caution. The VIX at 16.87 is elevated but not panicked, yet combined with a 10Y Yield at 4.16% and a Fed Funds Rate at 3.64%, it reflects a \"higher-for-longer\" reality that pressures equity valuations. The US Equity Risk Premium of 4.33% suggests stocks are not cheap relative to bonds.\n*   **News Flow:** Mixed but leaning negative. News of Nike's China woes and a fund's bad bet on Ambarella point to stock-specific risks and earnings fragility. The focus on private credit scrutiny (Bloomberg) signals regulatory risk in a hot market.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES: **MACRO UNCERTAINTY & NARRATIVE DIVERGENCE**\n\n1.  **Inflation & Economic Data Distrust:** The hottest Reddit topic questions the validity of government inflation data (\"Zero Housing Inflation\" claim). This creates a narrative gap where official reports may not align with public/perceived experience, fueling market skepticism and potential for violent reactions to data.\n2.  **Global Central Bank Policy Shift:** **Japan's move is critical.** The BOJ hiking to a 30-year high and the 10Y JGB yield crossing 2% is a seismic shift in global capital flows. This could reduce the historic \"yen carry trade,\" increase global borrowing costs, and trigger repatriation flows out of US and other foreign assets.\n3.  **Political & Fiscal Anxiety:** Discussions on taxing the rich, the $38T debt burden, and generational wealth transfer reveal underlying concerns about fiscal sustainability and political risk, which can drive sector rotation (e.g., away from high-debt growth stocks).\n4.  **Event-Driven Volatility:** \"Quadruple Witching\" (expiration of futures and options) is explicitly flagged for record volume. This is a known technical catalyst for amplified intraday moves and potential gamma squeezes/unwinds.\n5.  **Speculative Mania & Meme Echoes:** Mentions of Trump Media's speculative merger, a crypto mining windfall, and Google's erroneous GME price hint at lingering pockets of extreme retail speculation, which are often contra-indicators of broader market health.\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (Today):** **Quadruple Witching Expiration.** Expect elevated volume and heightened volatility, especially in heavily optioned names. This can distort price action and exacerbate moves.\n*   **Key Macro Signal:** **Bank of Japan Policy Tightening.** This is the most significant macro development. Watch for USD/JPY weakness and potential pressure on US Treasuries as a major buyer (BOJ) potentially steps back.\n*   **Sentiment Signal:** **Burry Teasing.** Michael Burry's re-emergence in discussion often coincides with heightened bearishness and focus on systemic risk.\n*   **Sector Warning Signal:** **Nike's 10% drop on China weakness** is a canary in the coal mine for consumer brands and multinationals exposed to Chinese consumer demand.\n*   **Contrarian Data Point:** The Bloomberg headline \"A Big Surprise From Small Companies\" suggests potential underlying strength in small-caps (Russell 2000), which could be a positive divergence if broad markets weaken.\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n### PRIMARY RISKS:\n1.  **Volatility Shock:** Quad witching + skeptical sentiment + high VIX creates a tinderbox for a sharp, news-driven selloff.\n2.  **Liquidity Drain from Japan:** The BOJ's normalization could lead to a sustained withdrawal of Japanese liquidity from global markets, a secular headwind.\n3.  **Earnings Deterioration:** Nike's miss highlights the risk of further earnings disappointments, particularly in consumer sectors.\n4.  **Narrative Crisis:** If distrust in economic data widens, it could undermine the fundamental basis for market valuations, leading to de-rating.\n\n### PRIMARY OPPORTUNITIES:\n1.  **Volatility Premium:** Elevated VIX and event risk make selling option premium (e.g., credit spreads) attractive for experienced traders.\n2.  **Flight to Quality:** In a risk-off move, large-cap quality (low debt, strong cash flow) and traditional hedges (Gold, Utilities) may outperform.\n3.  **Small-Cap Resilience:** If the \"surprise from small companies\" theme gains traction, it could signal a rotational opportunity out of overvalued mega-caps.\n4.  **Private Credit Scrutiny:** Increased regulatory oversight (per Bloomberg) may benefit publicly traded BDCs or more transparent lenders.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n\n*   **SECTOR: Financials (Banks & Brokers)** - **WATCH FOR STRESS.** Higher global yields are a double-edged sword. Net interest margins may improve, but trading desks face quad witching volatility, and investment banks face private credit scrutiny. Monitor $JPM, $GS for direction.\n*   **SECTOR: Japanese Equities & Currency** - **CAUTIOUSLY BULLISH.** BOJ hikes signal confidence in the domestic economy. A stronger yen (FXY) could hurt exporters but benefit financials. This is a major thematic shift requiring research.\n*   **SYMBOL: SOXS** - **SHORT-TERM HEDGE CONSIDERATION.** The Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X ETF is up sharply in the snapshot. This indicates acute sector weakness. While highly risky, it reflects market fear in tech. Do not hold long-term.\n*   **SYMBOL: FOLD** - **INVESTIGATE CATALYST.** Amicus Therapeutics is up +30.26% pre-market on no specified news in this data. Such a move suggests a material catalyst (trial data, FDA news). High risk, but the move demands scrutiny for biotech momentum traders.\n*   **ACTION: REDUCE LEVERAGE & DEFENSIVE POSITIONING.** Given the macro crosscurrents (Japan, witching, data distrust), it is prudent to reduce portfolio beta, avoid excessive leverage, and raise cash levels into today's session.\n*   **WATCH: RUSSEL 2000 (IWM)** vs. **NASDAQ 100 (QQQ).** The \"small company surprise\" narrative vs. mega-cap tech weakness (semiconductors bearish) sets up a potential rotation. IWM/QQQ relative strength is a key watch today.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market faces a tactical volatility event (witching) atop a shifting strategic landscape (BOJ policy). Retail sentiment is bearish and distrustful, which can itself be a fuel for sharp moves. Prioritize capital preservation over aggression today. Focus on identifying relative strength (e.g., small-caps vs. large tech) as the session develops.",

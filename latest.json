      "content": "TSLA's epic surge: With its core business collapsing, why did its stock price reach a new all-time high of $491.5?\n\nTSLA surged against the market trend today, reaching a new all-time high of $491.5, while Elon Musk's net worth soared to over $670 billion.  This stands in stark contrast to the company's core business struggles, including a nearly 40% drop in European sales and institutional forecasts of declining Q4 deliveries. The truth is: Wall Street has completely abandoned fundamental analysis of TSLA's automotive business. They are making a massive gamble that Musk will successfully transform into the core of an AI empire $1.6 trillion market capitalization is just the beginning. What they truly value is the $1 trillion profit potential of the FSD software, the multi-trillion-dollar market for CyberCab and Optimus robots by 2026, and the epic narrative of the SpaceX space economy behind it all. This high-risk gamble, which completely ties personal wealth, grand narratives, and extreme valuations together, means that TSLA is a bet that will either reach $3 trillion or see its dreams shattered.\n\nAt this point, would you buy at a high price, or would you wait and see?",

      "content": "According to sources Warner Bros. may reject Paramount's $108.4 billion acquisition offer and instead support Netflix in the bidding war\n\nDecember 16 (Reuters)  Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors may announce its decision on Paramount Sky Dance's $108.4 billion acquisition offer as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. The board is expected to recommend shareholders vote against the bid.\n\nThe renewed acceptance of Netflix's acquisition offer marks the latest development in this bidding war. The target of this contest includes Warner Bros.' storied film and television studio, along with its vast library of movies and TV shows a portfolio spanning classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to contemporary hits such as Harry Potter and Friends, as well as the HBO and HBO Max streaming services.\n\nA Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe winner will gain a significant advantage in the streaming wars by securing a vast content library that has long been a target for acquisition.\n\nEarlier this month, Netflix ultimately prevailed in its $27 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Warner Bros.' non-cable assets.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison subsequently made a direct, all-cash $30-per-share takeover bid to Warner Bros. shareholders.\n\nParamount stated in filings submitted to regulators that its acquisition proposal is superior to Netflix's bid and more likely to secure regulatory approval. Paramount's acquisition plan consists of $41 billion in new equity backed by the Ellison family and Redbird Capital, along with $54 billion in debt financing commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo Global Management.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Affinity Partners, a firm owned by Jared Kushner and one of Paramount Pictures' financing partners, will withdraw from the competition.\n\nParamount Pictures and Affinity Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.",

Few months ago it traded a similar or even lesser mcap to Amazon. The run up on Google was justified due to the company rapidly building and scaling its AI products. The important question to ask is the scope of higher return from here on especially since so much is priced into the stock.\n\nAmazon on the other hand has been viewed as a company with lesser growth outlook due to tariff and rising competition to its AWS business. I look at it differently. They are spending aggressively on AI infrastructure, if they build lot of capacity, they have a way to monetize it in one way or another since they have a more diversified stream of businesses. They also have scope of expanding their retail margins all of which can contribute to growing its earning power significantly.\n\nLong Amazon!",

      "content": "Saylor Says Lost Bitcoin May Need Freezing As Quantum Risk Rises\n\n\nI was surprised to see the debate this raised.  Gaining consensus is priority number one. That is hard because OGs don't like the term \"freeze.\" The proposal isn't writing rules to freeze particular keys, it is preventing use of signatures that are unsecure. So all holders would be given time to transition to private keys that are secure against post quantum capabilities.  I think Lopp frames the right questions and counterpoints. \n\nI've raised my thoughts on this as well and posted some ideas on how to transition.  I actually agree it doesn't make sense to leave open a method where quantum computing can steal keys.\n\nClosing that gap may come at the expense of some that fail to ever transition, but if they've been given years to transition, there isn't a strong argument that it isn't fair.  Securing the chain needs to happen.\n\nI've followed the quantum resistant coin category for a long time as a holder of Qanplatform.\n\nWhile many of the projects in the space talk about how they hope to capitalize from users seeking assets already prepared, I still view that as a long shot play.  Which is why most have moved toward building utilty chains. \n\nI think there is a large market incoming as all systems will be making upgrades.  Combining cryptography transition methods and blockchain utility will offer solutions enterprises want.  And they don't have the same decentralized challenges to overcome.  They can start implementing now, and we are seeing that happen.\n\nGlad to see the shift where nearly all coins are working on their approach.  It will be messy- some will falter and some will emerge.  It's worth paying attention to.  \n",

      "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's hostile bid\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery urged shareholders on Wednesday to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, stating the offer posed “significant risks and costs” to the company while Netflix's earlier proposal held greater value.\n\nMultiple companies have previously competed for Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns numerous classic films including Casablanca and the Harry Potter series. On December 5, Netflix agreed to acquire a portion of Warner Bros. Discovery for $82.7 billion; Paramount Skydance Media Group followed suit on December 8, offering to acquire the entire media group for $30 per share in an all-cash deal.\n\nNetflix has agreed to acquire Warner Bros.' HBO and its streaming and studio businesses, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 per share.\n\nParamount Sky Dance CEO David Ellison called it “a superior all-cash offer” when proposing to acquire all shares of Warner Bros. Discovery. Ellison stated that merging Warner Bros. Discovery's assets with those of Paramount Sky Dance (parent company of CBS News) would facilitate regulatory approval.\n\nA Paramount Pictures spokesperson has not yet responded to requests for comment.\n\nWhy Warner Bros. Discovery Favors Netflix\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery advised shareholders to reject Paramount Pictures' offer, stating its board believes the regulatory risks of both acquisition proposals are comparable. The company also indicated its analysis found Netflix's proposal which includes cash and Netflix stock to be more advantageous.\n\nThis has also raised concerns about the $40.65 billion equity investment in Paramount Sky Dance Media. Warner Bros. Discovery responded by stating, “The Ellison family has made no investment commitment of any kind.” According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person with a net worth of $243 billion.\n\nShortly before WarnerMedia made its proposal, Affinity Partners one of Paramount Sky Dance's financial backers announced its withdrawal from the hostile takeover bid. Affinity is a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAn Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that while the firm still believes Paramount Sky Dance's acquisition proposal holds “strong strategic merit,” it decided to withdraw due to “significant shifts in investment dynamics since our initial participation in October.”\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, the Warner Bros. Discovery board stated it views Netflix as having superior financial health, higher credit ratings, and greater market capitalization.\n\nThe letter stated: “Netflix's merger is fully backed by a publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion and an investment-grade balance sheet.”\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery added that Paramount Sky Dance's credit rating “is at or just one notch above ‘junk’ status with two major rating agencies,” while its market capitalization stands at $15 billion.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery also expressed concerns about Paramount's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its acquisition offer.\n\n“The trust's assets and liabilities would not be publicly disclosed and could change,” it wrote in its letter to shareholders. “As the name implies, revocable trusts typically contain provisions allowing assets to be transferred at any time.”\n\nAlthough Wednesday's shareholder letter indicated that Paramount's acquisition offer is not favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide whether to accept Paramount's bid for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery, and TNT.\n\n",

      "content": "Kushner just dipped from the WBD bid mess does anything really change?\n\nI’ve been watching the Warner Bros situation, and it’s starting to feel like one of those cases where the headlines are louder than the fundamentals, except now the headlines have turned into an actual bidding war.\n\nThe latest development is pretty straightforward. Jared Kushner’s PE firm, Affinity Partners, has pulled its financing support from Paramount Skydance’s hostile bid. From what’s been reported, it was only about a $200M check in the grand scheme of things, but it still mattered. It wasn’t a big piece of the financing, but it was a politically connected name, and that backing is now gone. (News source, if you’re interested: [Netflix CEOs Defend WBD Buy, Pivot To Theaters.](https://www.moneyai-app.com/share/session?shareUuid=bf87e276-0fb9-4408-a192-da2a4daf64f3))\n\nNetflix already has an agreed deal to buy WBD at $27.75 per share, or roughly $72B. Paramount Skydance countered with a $30 per share all cash hostile offer aimed directly at shareholders. The reporting so far suggests WBD’s board is leaning toward sticking with Netflix rather than engaging with the hostile bid.\n\nWhat makes this situation feel unusual to me is that non financial factors are wrapped around the deal.\n\nParamount’s bid comes with big name backers, but it also brings political baggage. The CBS and Trump comments have pulled the deal into the public spotlight, which can slow the process down even if the headline price looks higher on paper.\n\nWBD’s Q3 2025 release showed about $9.0B in revenue, down excluding FX. The market has been watching whether improvements in streaming profitability can continue to offset the decline in linear networks, especially with the debt load still hanging over the company. That’s why Affinity walking away doesn’t really change how I read the situation. It hurts the optics of the hostile bid, but it doesn’t suddenly make the Netflix deal look worse, or make the underlying tradeoffs any simpler.",

Both parties will also explore collaboration in e-commerce which, admittedly, was within my expectations.\n\nFor both parties, OpenAI can alleviate over $100 billion in computational power and talent investment pressures over the next four years while reducing its single source dependency on Nvidia chips. Amazon, meanwhile, gains a heavyweight client for its Trainium chips, bolsters its AI strategic positioning, and counters Microsoft's competitive edge.\n\nAt the industry level, this partnership could break Nvidia's monopoly in the AI chip market Trainium's cost performance advantage may reshape industry cost structures and drive down AI computing prices.\n\nSimultaneously, the formation of a tech giant alliance centered on “capital + computing power + models” will accelerate. Competitors like Microsoft and Google may intensify their countermeasures, shifting global AI competition from isolated technological rivalry to ecosystem based collaboration.

      "content": "NBIS is a steal at this price, change my mind\n\nI’m currently averaged at $96 on Nebius and I definitely wish I’d waited a bit longer to build my position. At these levels though, I genuinely think the stock is massively undervalued. A lot of the recent decline feels driven by bad sentiment driven by bad sentiment and a broader sell off after Oracle’s earnings. At current pricing, this looks like one of the biggest steals in the market to me.\n\nHere's why:   \n\n\n**- AI compute is structurally undersupplied.** \n\nThis is not a short cycle issue. Training and inference demand keeps growing faster than GPU supply, power availability and data center capacity. Companies that can actually deliver large scale GPU clusters with power and networking are the bottleneck.\n\nNebius sits right in that bottleneck.\n\n  \n**- Hyperscaler validation matters more than narratives**  \nMicrosoft signed up to $19.4B in multi year GPU capacity. Meta followed with another $3B. These are not pilot projects or optional experiments. This is mission critical infrastructure.\n\nIf Microsoft and Meta are willing to rely on Nebius for AI compute, the tech works and the execution bar has already been cleared at a very high level.\n\n  \n\\- **Extreme growth**   \nQ3 revenue was up 355% YoY.  \nARR today is roughly $550M and guided to ramp to $7–9B by the end of 2026 as contracted capacity comes online.  \nAI operations are already EBITDA positive with margins around 20%.\n\n**- Capex is not the problem people think it is**  \nYes, capex is massive. That is the business. But Nebius is sitting on roughly $5B in cash and raised convertibles at extremely low interest rates. Capital markets are clearly comfortable financing this growth because the demand is locked in by secured deals.\n\n  \n**- This is the most important one, everyone keeps forgetting the extra assets they own besides the cloud business**   \nMost people talk about Nebius as if it’s just an AI cloud provider. That’s missing a big part of the picture.\n\nOn top of the cloud business, Nebius still owns several assets that have real value and are basically being priced at a huge discount or in my opinion even close to zero (!!) by the market right now.\n\nAvride ($2-3B valuation) is now partnered with Uber. Avride is working with Uber on delivery robots, which is a massive market on its own.\n\nThen there’s TripleTen ($300-500M)growing fast in a high margin digital space\n\nOn top of that, Nebius still has stakes in things like AI data annotation and database tech through Toloka and ClickHouse ($2B) . These aren’t random side projects, they sit right in the AI value chain and have raised at serious private valuations in the past.\n\nIf you do even conservative sum of the parts math, you’re talking about several billion in value outside of the core cloud business. Right now, the market seems to be valuing Nebius almost purely as “AI cloud plus execution risk” and ignoring everything else. \n\nIf Nebius actually hits the target of  $7–9B ARR in 2026, you’re looking at a forward revenue multiple of roughly 2.4x for the core cloud business. While others easily have a multiple of 5-10. \n\n**- The real risks**  \nI don't want to turn a blind eye to the risk, because ofc there are:   \n\\- Data center build timelines slipping  \n\\- Customer concentration  \n\\- Share dilution over time\n\nAll real. But they are execution risks, not demand risks. Chance of execution is (in my opinion) the highest at Nebius compared to others, because of their former Yandex experience.   \n  \nThis all seems to good to be true to me, so please convince me if i'm missing something here. Even a base case should provide a valuation of roughly 120-150$ according to my research. \n\n\n\n",

A single expectation change can attract incremental volume, which changes visibility, which can change financing terms and media coverage. That loop does not require perfection. It only requires the market to believe the next few quarters look better than the last few.\n\n\n\nRIME has a few ingredients that make this dynamic possible. The company is around a $5M market cap, and it already shows up in institutional filings. Fintel compiled data lists Vanguard Group at about 20,010 shares and Geode Capital Management at about 19,606 shares, alongside index fund exposure through extended market funds (source type: 13F and NPORT filings as compiled by Fintel). Those are small positions, but they confirm the ticker sits inside institutional data systems.\n\n\n\nOn the business side, SemiCab slides shown privately cite ARR rising from about $2.1M to roughly $15.0M over about 18 months, plus enterprise contracts sized above $5M per year and one above $8M per year (source: company presentation). If even part of that trajectory becomes visible in public filings, the valuation could reset from a low base.\n\n\n\n Do your own research.",

      "content": "What’s the most persistent problem you ran into while building your business and how did you finally fix it?\n\nEvery founder I’ve met has that one annoying problem that just would not go away, the kind that quietly drains your time, energy, and sanity until you eventually crack the code. \n\nFor some people it’s hiring, for others it’s consistency, product-market fit, cash flow, whatever. So I’m genuinely curious: what was the most stubborn pain point in your startup journey, and what finally solved it for you? For me, the one thing that stuck around way longer than it should have was multi-account management. \n\nI run several niche pages as part of my business model, and juggling them was honestly way harder than building the business itself. Logging in/out constantly, mixing up accounts, browser fingerprints acting weird, random lockouts... I wasted so much time trying to manage everything manually that it actually slowed down the rest of my work. I finally solved it by building a proper setup with a few tools. The foundation is AdsPower, mostly because it lets me keep each account in its own clean browser environment without stepping on each other. On top of that, I pair it with Buffer for queued posts so I’m not scrambling all day. That combo basically removed 90% of the stress. And if anyone else is dealing with the same headache: Adspower currently has a code (reddittry) that gives you 10 new IP environments for free, which is worth testing before committing. \n\nSo what was yours? What problem kept haunting you even after you thought you’d solved it - and what finally made it click?",

      "content": "Is Robinhood going to cannibalize it's self with it's massive push with betting?\n\nIf you're an investor with Hood you know the whole prediction markets/betting has been a surge for the stock so far this year. The price has jumped up and the annualized revenue rate looks encouraging so far. With Hood's large user base it is positioning itself as a power fintech player.\n\nBut I can't help to think that this might not be the slam dunk they think it is if they go all in. Yes, this will encourage more users to put in money their accounts to make some bets but I can't help to think for many users they will draw against their accounts as money for most users is finite. \n\nBut what happens if large percentage of users start betting? What happens when users start losing money big and all of a sudden users need to sell their portfolio to cover for the loses? Robinhood takes a hit on it's AUM and that user may not buy more stocks or deposite money in his account for a while. Also, if a user has $1000 to invest they perhaps in the past will buy it on equities and maybe a smaller portion on options. Will they now just allocate a portion to betting? Robinhood also takes only a small portion of each event contract so it's not like a $1 bet = $1 profit for Hood. \n\nI get why Robinhood went in on the betting and it's proven to be a hit so far. But I can't help to think they might just be cannibalizing themselves in the long run..",

NXХТ still generates most of its revenue from mobile fueling and energy logistics, but management commentary increasingly emphasizes infrastructure and grid-adjacent solutions, per recent filings.\n\nThe logic is clear. Data centers, healthcare facilities, and industrial sites face grid constraints. On-site generation and microgrids address that need. Even a small portfolio of PPAs introduces duration and predictability that service revenue lacks.\n\nThis does not mean the transition is guaranteed. Infrastructure projects take time, capital, and operational discipline. Missteps would likely show up as delays and higher losses.\n\nFor now, investors are watching whether these projects remain isolated announcements or become a steady pipeline. The answer will shape how the market values the company.\n\nDo your own research",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-17 13:02:06  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n### 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Bearish with Elevated Uncertainty**  \n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Overwhelmingly negative. Themes include frustration with market returns (e.g., \"The entire market is a joke\"), political concerns (Trump’s jobs promise), and skepticism toward wealth/inequality. Retail traders appear discouraged, with high engagement on losses, regulatory actions (Tesla), and stock-specific disappointments (Oracle, GME data issues).  \n- **Macro/Technical Data:** VIX at 16.48 suggests moderate fear. Rising gold/oil (per RSS) and elevated 10Y yield (4.18%) point to defensive positioning and inflation/geopolitical worries.  \n- **RSS News Tone:** Mixed but cautionary—highlighting risks (geopolitics), regulatory readiness (Tenev comments), and record CLO sales signaling credit risk appetite.  \n- **Conclusion:** Sentiment is bearish-driven by retail disillusionment, geopolitical risks, and sector-specific pressures (tech, autos). Institutional signals (CLO demand, Medline IPO success) show pockets of risk-taking, but overall mood is defensive.\n\n---\n\n### 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES  \n**a) Tech Sector Stress:**  \n- Oracle down 4–6% on failed data center funding (Reddit #2, #15).  \n- NVDA down 3.81% (FMP data), possibly reflecting broader tech volatility.  \n- Amazon’s $10B OpenAI investment (Reddit #7) contrasts with sector weakness—highlighting divergence between AI leaders and laggards.  \n\n**b) Regulatory & Political Risks:**  \n- Tesla Autopilot deceptive marketing ruling (Reddit #13) threatens regulatory overhang on tech/auto.  \n- Trump policy doubts (Reddit #3) and inequality reports (Reddit #10) fueling political uncertainty.  \n- Tenev (Bloomberg) emphasizing regulatory tools—suggests policymakers are on alert.  \n\n**c) Market Structure Concerns:**  \n- Retail trader exhaustion (Reddit #6, #14) and declining crypto activity (SOL, Reddit #12).  \n- GME data anomalies (Reddit #11) raising suspicions of market transparency issues.  \n\n**d) Geopolitical & Macro Fears:**  \n- Gold/oil rising (RSS #3) due to geopolitical risks.  \n- Inflation (CPI 324.368) and elevated yields (10Y at 4.18%) sustaining stagflation worries.  \n\n**e) IPO & Credit Momentum:**  \n- Medline IPO success (RSS #2, #10) and record CLO sales (RSS #6) indicate robust institutional risk appetite in select areas.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Catalysts (Next 1–2 Days):**  \n- **Oracle (ORCL):** Watch for further sell-off if no alternative funding emerges for data centers.  \n- **Tesla (TSLA):** 90-day Autopilot fix deadline—failure risks license suspension, could pressure stock.  \n- **Geopolitical Triggers:** Any escalation could spike oil/gold and volatility (VIX).  \n\n**Underlying Signals:**  \n- **Credit Market Strength:** Record CLO sales contrast with equity fear—suggests institutional capital is shifting toward structured credit.  \n- **Retail Capitulation:** Reddit sentiment shows frustration and reduced activity (SOL decline)—often a contrarian signal but not yet extreme.  \n- **Sector Rotation:** Tech weakness (NVDA, ORCL) vs. IPO/CLO strength hints at rotation from growth to value/private credit.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Tech Sector Breakdown:** Oracle/Tesla issues could spread to broader tech, especially if funding or regulatory pressures mount.  \n2. **Political Uncertainty:** Trump policy doubts and inequality tensions may weaken consumer sentiment and fiscal outlook.  \n3. **Geopolitical Shock:** Rising gold/oil suggests market is pricing in unseen risks—any escalation could trigger broad sell-off.  \n4. **Retail Liquidity Drain:** Declining trader activity (SOL, Reddit fatigue) may reduce market depth, amplifying volatility.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Defensive Assets:** Gold (GLD) and oil continue to benefit from risk-off sentiment.  \n2. **IPO/Credit Markets:** Strong demand for CLOs and IPOs (Medline) signals capital availability for high-quality new issues.  \n3. **Contrarian Tech Entry:** If NVDA/ORCL stabilize, oversold AI/cloud names (e.g., AMZN) may rebound on long-term trends.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**SYMBOL: ORCL** – Monitor for stabilization above $115–$120. Failure to secure data center funding could lead to further downgrades. Avoid until clarity emerges.  \n**SYMBOL: TSLA** – High risk. Regulatory overhang likely to persist through Q1 2026. Consider hedging or reducing exposure until DMV resolution.  \n**SYMBOL: GLD** – Bullish. Geopolitical risks and stagflation fears support gold. Target $410–$420 near-term.  \n**SYMBOL: NVDA** – Wait for support. Current drop may not be over; watch $165–$168 level for potential bounce. AI narrative remains intact long-term.  \n**SECTOR: Credit/CLOs** – Favorable. Record CLO demand signals institutional confidence. Consider exposure via ETFs like CLOZ or CLOI.  \n**SECTOR: Tech (Selective)** – Focus on companies with strong AI partnerships (e.g., AMZN) and avoid regulatory-heavy names (autos, data center dependents).  \n**GENERAL: Reduce day-trading** – Reddit sentiment shows retail fatigue. Volatility may hurt short-term strategies. Favor longer-term macro plays (defensive assets, credit).  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** The market is in a risk-off phase driven by tech disappointments, regulatory fears, and geopolitical tensions. Retail sentiment is bearish, but institutional flows show appetite for credit and select IPOs. Prioritize defense (gold, credit) over growth tech until volatility subsides. Watch Oracle and Tesla for sector-wide spillover signals.",

The offering is expected to raise over $30 billion, though final timing will hinge on broader market conditions and investor appetite.\n\nSpaceX is already the world’s most valuable private company, and the proposed IPO would shatter the previous record for a public listing surpassing Saudi Aramco’s $29.4 billion offering in 2019.",

      "content": "Lyft -8% and Uber -7% as Waymo plans 1M weekly robotaxi rides and a major 2026 city expansion\n\nSource: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2025/12/10/waymo-targets-1-million-robotaxi-rides-a-week/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2025/12/10/waymo-targets-1-million-robotaxi-rides-a-week/)\n\n&gt;Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving tech unit, expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year, aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan. It’s the first time that the company, which started in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car project, has set a hard target for its business.\n\n&gt;Currently, the Mountain View, California-based company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Bay Area communities, Austin, Atlanta and, as of last month, Miami. That’s “a number that we’re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026,” Waymo said in a blog post. “As we look to 2026, we’re laying the early groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including international cities like Tokyo and London.”\n\n&gt;Waymo doesn’t share financial data, but various estimates suggest it makes at least $20 per ride, which adds up to more than $20 million a month. At 1 million rides per week, its annualized revenue would hit about $1 billion, a milestone for the early-stage robotaxi market. To handle that volume of rides the company’s fleet will likely expand to at least 10,000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2,500 now, likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar I-Pace SUVs.\n\n&gt;Though the service has proved popular with riders, Waymo’s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges. The company’s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco, for example, following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat, a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors. Last month, a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street. Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company, which hasn’t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans, needs to make additional safety upgrades.\n\n&gt;Additionally, Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses.\n\n&gt;“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s Waymo's chief safety officer, said in a statement.\n\n&gt;That said, Waymo’s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space, including General Motors’ Cruise unit, which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco. Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving, is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its so-called Full Self-Driving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use. Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it’s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD.\n\n&gt;But while Waymo’s safety issues so far haven’t been as serious, some critics think it’s expanding too fast, perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit.\n\n&gt;“We are left to wonder why the \\`world’s most experienced driver’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience,” Phil Koopman, an autonomous driving researcher and Carnegie-Mellon University professor, said in a blog post. “Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can’t shrug off. It’s unclear which will happen first.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdb2y6co2f6g1.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a57c7fde70895c2f2a58a9e940a52b32e0a1e342\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/issbp02p2f6g1.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f145ac6455a4fff50d43087cf8bb43b80713c4b3",

      "content": "Global Bond Yields Hit 16-Year High on Fading Rate-Cut Bets\n\nGlobal bond markets flashed a warning signal ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Long-dated government bond yields have climbed to levels last seen in 2009, suggesting traders are starting to question whether the era of broad rate-cut cycles is actually ending. A Bloomberg index tracking long-term sovereign yields is now back at 16-year highs. Futures markets reflect that shift: expectations for additional cuts from the European Central Bank have essentially vanished, Japan is seen as almost certain to hike this month, and Australia is now priced for two more quarter-point increases next year. The move comes just as the Fed prepares to announce its next decision. While most investors still expect a cut on Wednesday, the broader message from global markets is that easing may not last as long or run as deep as previously hoped. Anyone else watching this tightening narrative re-emerge? Bond markets usually sniff out trends early, and this feels like a meaningful shift.\n\n\n\nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html)",

Here’s what to expect\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third straight meeting on Wednesday, but this one feels less straightforward than the last two. Inside the FOMC, there’s a clear split: some members want continued cuts to protect a cooling labor market, while others worry that easing too much could re-ignite inflation pressures. Beyond the rate decision itself, most of the focus will likely be on the updated dot plot and economic projections, which should give a better sense of how policymakers see the path forward. The cut looks likely, but the forward guidance may be doing most of the talking this time.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/the-fed-decision-is-expected-to-feature-a-rate-cut-and-a-lot-more-heres-what-to-expect.html?__source=androidappshare",

Here’s what to expect\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third straight meeting on Wednesday, but this one feels less straightforward than the last two. Inside the FOMC, there’s a clear split: some members want continued cuts to protect a cooling labor market, while others worry that easing too much could re-ignite inflation pressures. Beyond the rate decision itself, most of the focus will likely be on the updated dot plot and economic projections, which should give a better sense of how policymakers see the path forward. The cut looks likely, but the forward guidance may be doing most of the talking this time.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/the-fed-decision-is-expected-to-feature-a-rate-cut-and-a-lot-more-heres-what-to-expect.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

Here's the breakdown.\n\nWe've been running a scoring algorithm on S&amp;P 500 stocks since August. Basically scores companies on fundamentals and how they stack up against sector peers, then runs them through some validation checks. Only 5 stocks make the cut each month.\n\nMastercard broke in for the first time at #5 on 1st December. The profitability on this thing is genuinely ridiculous. 196.9% return on equity, 45.3% net margins. Scored perfect marks on returns and margin efficiency. Analysts are bullish too: 49 of 62 have it as a Buy, with literally zero Sells, and the consensus implies about 21% upside.\n\nThe problem is valuation. Stockoscope DCF puts intrinsic value around $382  based on 12.9% growth for 5 years, followed by 5 years of tapering growth to 2%, discounted at 8.1% (and it's trading at $537 currently). That's a pretty big premium to pay, even for something this high quality. The growth would have to be around 20% for it to be fairly valued.  \n  \nTechnicals: Currently, it is down 11% from the highs, and there is a nice support  around the 500 levels, which would be around a 16% drop from the top. That would be a better entry than the current level, of course.\n\nCurious where others land on this. The quality is undeniable, but it's a bit pricey. \n\nNot financial advice. DYOR.",

      "content": "Nvidia refutes report that China’s DeepSeek is using its banned Blackwell AI chips\n\nNvidia pushed back on a report claiming that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is using smuggled Blackwell chips to train its upcoming model. The company said it has “not seen any substantiation” to support the claim. The allegation came from *The Information*, which reported that restricted Nvidia hardware had somehow made its way into China despite export controls. Nvidia’s response was short and direct, signaling that they don’t believe the report is backed by solid evidence at this point. This comes at a time when scrutiny around chip exports, enforcement, and possible leakages is already intense. If anything concrete does surface, it could have serious implications but for now, it’s still unproven. What do you think noise, or something regulators will dig into deeper?\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/nvidia-report-china-deepseek-ai-blackwell-chips.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/nvidia-report-china-deepseek-ai-blackwell-chips.html)",

      "content": "WeRide - longterm plays in autonomous vehicles market\n\nWeRide approach in 2 folds: regulatory and partnership \n\nRegulatory: they operate in 8 different countries and 11 cities (Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia, Belgium, France, Switzerland, China and US). WeRide received L4 driverless city permit in Abu Dhabi, outside of US. They turned their permits and reg approvals into real operating advantage. We can clearly see that WeRide is the first mover and leader in those countries. Working with Grab and Uber to operate their fleets gives them an access to huge target bases. Also, WeRide enters ADAS market, partnered with Bosch gives them more credibility in the auto market. \n\nInstitutional side: recently, ARK Invest purchased 858,295 shares of WeRide and extra 17,326 shares bia ARKQ. BofA, City and BOCI all applied a BUY rating on this stock, showing a long-term confidence in them. Their shareholders include: Fidelity, Greenwoods, Hudson Bay, Invesco, M&amp;G, Mirae Asset, Morgan Stanley IM, Temasek, and NVIDIA.\n\nThis is a super heavy capital industry and not cheap to operate. It's not realistic to expect them to have profits right away. However, when you look closely into their strategy, their partnerships and especially their Q3 performance, you can see the numbers have been improving quarter to quarter. Imo, this company is having a huge potential in the whole auto space in the next few years, they doing the real things instead of saying and doing nothing on press.",

This represents a significant commitment, clearly signaling a long term dedication to deepening its presence in India.\n\nThis move appears to have dual implications for Amazon:\n\nPositives: India's e-commerce demand continues to grow rapidly. Large scale investment could accelerate Amazon's market share and logistics advantages locally. Long term, it may become a new growth engine.\n\nRisks: The massive investment and long return cycle, coupled with India's intense competition and complex regulations, may not necessarily translate into profits. The short term boost to stock prices could also be limited.\n\nI see this as a classic case of long term upside with short term uncertainty.\n\nDoes this news make you more optimistic about AMZN's long term value?

      "title": "2026 Stock Market Outlook: How Long Can the AI Hype Last Amid Policy Risks and Election Uncertainty?",
      "content": "2026 Stock Market Outlook: How Long Can the AI Hype Last Amid Policy Risks and Election Uncertainty?\n\nEveryone is starting to ask what next year’s market outlook will be. So let’s study Wall Street’s latest New Year forecasts together. The market has really been wild lately. One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia’s earnings, thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years, and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google. The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half.\n\nSo the question is: how long can this wave last? After this round of Christmas gains, will next year keep taking off or fall flat? Every year end, those suit-and-tie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year. This year, I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish. Eternal bull market.\n\nThe most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank. They boldly claim the S&amp;P 500 could reach 8000 points next year, nearly a 20% increase. Keep in mind, the S&amp;P has already risen more than 10% this year, and they still want more. Why so optimistic? It basically comes down to two words: Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAI is no longer just a tech buzzword. It has become the engine of the entire capital market. Nvidia, Microsoft, Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI R&amp;D. Capital expenditure is at record highs. Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution.\n\nBut here’s the problem the S&amp;P 500 is now trading at a 25x P/E ratio, while the historical average is just above 15. Isn’t that expensive? It definitely is. But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don’t expand further, they can stay high. Why? Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong. Money is still flowing into equities, corporate buybacks haven’t stopped, and earnings expectations are rising. They even predict that in In 2026, EPS could reach $320.\n\nInterestingly, Morgan Stanley is also bullish, targeting 7800 points, yet they didn’t buy the Magnificent Seven. Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market. They prefer small caps, consumer discretionary, healthcare, financials, and industrials. Why? Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors, and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods. This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase.\n\nMore importantly, Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early. The logic is simple: if employment weakens, liquidity tightens, and risk assets fall, Powell won’t be able to hold he’ll have to pump liquidity back into the market. Once rates turn down, the valuation ceiling opens again.\n\nHSBC, Barclays, and UBS all agree. HSBC even said: who cares if there’s a bubble? The dot-com bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first. UBS even drew a bull scenario where the S&amp;P hits 8400. But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation. Capital spending is no longer only on AI chips it’s spreading across more industries.\n\nFrom my perspective, the U.S. market is still the top priority next year, but we shouldn’t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump’s second year in office. You might not know this, but historically, the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks.\n\nIn 2018, during Trump 1.0’s second year, the first half was great, then the market collapsed in the second half. The trade war began, tech stocks plunged, the VIX soared 70%, and even crypto and emerging markets crashed.\n\nAnd now? The script looks nearly identical. Policies change every day. Tariffs can hit at any time. Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes, the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers, retailers, and exporters lose sleep.\n\nPlus, the 2026 midterm elections are coming. Both parties will go all-out, meaning fiscal policy may freeze again, and market trust in the government will keep eroding.\n\nWhat’s worse, sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017. In the U.S., only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market. Materials, energy, real estate everything else is dropping. Europe isn’t much better. Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump.\n\nWhen only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant, it signals a fragile market. If tech stocks cool off, the entire market could lose momentum instantly.\n\nSo next year, political cycles, policy risks, and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won’t disappear. Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth. Wanting everything at once often ends badly.\n\nIn my view, the script may look like this:\n\nFirst half: AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again.\n\nSecond half: As midterm elections approach, policy noise increases, earnings get disrupted, and volatility returns.\n\nWhoever holds high valuation, low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk.",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-10 11:01:59  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT  \n**Overall Sentiment: Neutral to Cautiously Bullish**  \n\n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Mixed but leaning optimistic. Retail traders are focused on speculative themes (GameStop turnaround, AI defense contracts, crypto disillusionment) and macro-political risks (Fed policy, geopolitical tensions). High engagement on GME and PLTR suggests speculative retail momentum is building.  \n- **RSS News Tone:** Generally constructive. Focus on Fed rate cuts, ECB confidence in inflation, and strong IPO performances (Cardinal +9.5%) supports a risk-on narrative, though geopolitical risks (Ukraine-Russia shadow fleet attacks) linger.  \n- **Macro Data:**  \n  - **Fed Funds Rate (3.89%)** and **10Y Yield (4.17%)** indicate easing monetary policy is underway, supportive of equities.  \n  - **VIX at 16.93** suggests moderate but not extreme complacency.  \n  - **Equity Risk Premium (4.33%)** remains attractive relative to historical averages.  \n\n**Verdict:** Sentiment is bifurcated—institutional focus on rate cuts and economic resilience vs. retail speculative fervor and geopolitical anxiety.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES  \n**A. Monetary Policy Divergence & Forward Guidance**  \n- Fed poised for third rate cut (Reddit #1, RSS #7), but 2025 trajectory uncertain.  \n- ECB’s Makhlouf confident inflation will hit 2% medium-term (RSS #4), suggesting global central bank coordination toward easing.  \n\n**B. Geopolitical Risk & Fiscal Policy Uncertainty**  \n- Europe may dump U.S. Treasuries if Trump cuts Ukraine deal (Reddit #2)—a potential bond market shock.  \n- Ukraine-Russia shadow fleet attacks (RSS #6) could pressure oil and global trade lanes.  \n\n**C. Retail-Driven Speculative Mania**  \n- GameStop (GME) dominates Reddit discourse (#3, #6, #7, #13), with focus on six consecutive profitable quarters and “squeeze” predictions.  \n- AI/Defense: Palantir (PLTR) $448M Navy contract (Reddit #5) reinforces AI-as-a-theme in government spending.  \n\n**D. Economic Resilience vs. Consumer Strain**  \n- Trump’s “A+++++” economy review clashes with consumer pain (Reddit #4, #15—Cold Stone price outrage).  \n- “Forever Layoffs” (Reddit #12) and Cracker Barrel outlook cut (RSS #5) signal consumer discretionary headwinds.  \n\n**E. Crypto Disillusionment & Regulation**  \n- “I Wasted 8 Years in Crypto” viral note (Reddit #8) and Vitalik Buterin’s EU criticism (Reddit #9) highlight sector fatigue and regulatory friction.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Catalysts (Next 1–2 Days):**  \n- **Fed Rate Decision & Commentary:** Any hawkish lean could reverse recent equity gains.  \n- **GME Momentum:** Retail “squeeze” ban bets (Reddit #7) could drive volatile, high-volume moves.  \n- **Geopolitical Escalation:** Further Ukraine-Russia attacks may spike oil and defense stocks.  \n\n**Technical/Macro Signals:**  \n- **Yield Curve Steepening Trade:** Ex-Pimco manager betting on steeper curves in U.S./Canada (RSS #1)—implies reflation expectations.  \n- **IPO Strength:** Cardinal’s +9.5% post-IPO (RSS #10) signals healthy risk appetite for new issues.  \n- **Gold (GLD) at 386.82:** Holding steady despite rate cut expectations—suggests lingering hedge demand.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Geopolitical Shock:** European Treasury dumping threat is a tail risk for bond liquidity and USD.  \n2. **Retail Overextension:** GME/PLTR speculative frenzy could lead to sharp reversals if fundamentals disappoint.  \n3. **Consumer Weakness:** Layoffs and price sensitivity (Cold Stone example) may foreshadow slowing spending.  \n4. **Fed Communication Misstep:** Markets are priced for dovish cuts; any hesitation could trigger volatility.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Defense/AI Infrastructure:** PLTR contract signals sustained government AI spending.  \n2. **Steepener Trades:** Position for yield curve steepening via financials or duration-sensitive ETFs.  \n3. **IPO Pipeline:** Strong Cardinal debut may buoy recent and upcoming IPOs.  \n4. **Rate-Sensitive Sectors:** Utilities, REITs, and growth tech benefit from lower yields.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**SYMBOL: GME** – Monitor for high-volume breakout above recent resistance. Retail sentiment is extremely bullish, but beware of “sell the news” after earnings. High-risk, high-reward speculative play.  \n\n**SYMBOL: PLTR** – AI defense spending is a multi-year tailwind. The $448M Navy deal reinforces moat. Consider on pullbacks for a strategic position.  \n\n**SECTOR: Defense/Government Tech** – Geopolitical tensions and modernization drives (e.g., Navy AI overhaul) favor companies with strong government contracts (e.g., PLTR, LMT, NOC).  \n\n**SECTOR: Financials** – Bet on yield curve steepening (RSS #1). Regional banks (KRE) and brokerages may benefit from higher net interest margins and trading volume.  \n\n**MACRO: U.S. Treasuries** – Watch for European selling pressure if Ukraine deal emerges. Consider shortening duration or hedging with TBT (ultra-short Treasury ETF) if geopolitical risks escalate.  \n\n**MACRO: Consumer Discretionary** – Avoid or short companies with extreme pricing power backlash (e.g., restaurant chains). Focus on value-oriented consumer staples instead.  \n\n**TRADE IDEA: Long Steepener via EDV/TLT vs. SHY** – Position for rising long-term yields relative to short-term rates as Fed cuts proceed.  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**  \nThe market is at a crossroads—supported by central bank easing but threatened by geopolitical sparks and retail speculation. Focus on quality (defense/AI, financials) while hedging for volatility. Immediate attention on Fed language and GME/PLTR retail flows.  \n\n**Next Update:** Monitor Fed statement at 14:00 ET and any European official comments on Treasury holdings.",

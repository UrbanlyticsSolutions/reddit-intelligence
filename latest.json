      "content": "Saylor Says Lost Bitcoin May Need Freezing As Quantum Risk Rises\n\n\nI was surprised to see the debate this raised.  Gaining consensus is priority number one. That is hard because OGs don't like the term \"freeze.\" The proposal isn't writing rules to freeze particular keys, it is preventing use of signatures that are unsecure. So all holders would be given time to transition to private keys that are secure against post quantum capabilities.  I think Lopp frames the right questions and counterpoints. \n\nI've raised my thoughts on this as well and posted some ideas on how to transition.  I actually agree it doesn't make sense to leave open a method where quantum computing can steal keys.\n\nClosing that gap may come at the expense of some that fail to ever transition, but if they've been given years to transition, there isn't a strong argument that it isn't fair.  Securing the chain needs to happen.\n\nI've followed the quantum resistant coin category for a long time as a holder of Qanplatform.\n\nWhile many of the projects in the space talk about how they hope to capitalize from users seeking assets already prepared, I still view that as a long shot play.  Which is why most have moved toward building utilty chains. \n\nI think there is a large market incoming as all systems will be making upgrades.  Combining cryptography transition methods and blockchain utility will offer solutions enterprises want.  And they don't have the same decentralized challenges to overcome.  They can start implementing now, and we are seeing that happen.\n\nGlad to see the shift where nearly all coins are working on their approach.  It will be messy- some will falter and some will emerge.  It's worth paying attention to.  \n",

      "content": "NBIS is a steal at this price, change my mind\n\nI’m currently averaged at $96 on Nebius and I definitely wish I’d waited a bit longer to build my position. At these levels though, I genuinely think the stock is massively undervalued. A lot of the recent decline feels driven by bad sentiment driven by bad sentiment and a broader sell off after Oracle’s earnings. At current pricing, this looks like one of the biggest steals in the market to me.\n\nHere's why:   \n\n\n**- AI compute is structurally undersupplied.** \n\nThis is not a short cycle issue. Training and inference demand keeps growing faster than GPU supply, power availability and data center capacity. Companies that can actually deliver large scale GPU clusters with power and networking are the bottleneck.\n\nNebius sits right in that bottleneck.\n\n  \n**- Hyperscaler validation matters more than narratives**  \nMicrosoft signed up to $19.4B in multi year GPU capacity. Meta followed with another $3B. These are not pilot projects or optional experiments. This is mission critical infrastructure.\n\nIf Microsoft and Meta are willing to rely on Nebius for AI compute, the tech works and the execution bar has already been cleared at a very high level.\n\n  \n\\- **Extreme growth**   \nQ3 revenue was up 355% YoY.  \nARR today is roughly $550M and guided to ramp to $7–9B by the end of 2026 as contracted capacity comes online.  \nAI operations are already EBITDA positive with margins around 20%.\n\n**- Capex is not the problem people think it is**  \nYes, capex is massive. That is the business. But Nebius is sitting on roughly $5B in cash and raised convertibles at extremely low interest rates. Capital markets are clearly comfortable financing this growth because the demand is locked in by secured deals.\n\n  \n**- This is the most important one, everyone keeps forgetting the extra assets they own besides the cloud business**   \nMost people talk about Nebius as if it’s just an AI cloud provider. That’s missing a big part of the picture.\n\nOn top of the cloud business, Nebius still owns several assets that have real value and are basically being priced at a huge discount or in my opinion even close to zero (!!) by the market right now.\n\nAvride ($2-3B valuation) is now partnered with Uber. Avride is working with Uber on delivery robots, which is a massive market on its own.\n\nThen there’s TripleTen ($300-500M)growing fast in a high margin digital space\n\nOn top of that, Nebius still has stakes in things like AI data annotation and database tech through Toloka and ClickHouse ($2B) . These aren’t random side projects, they sit right in the AI value chain and have raised at serious private valuations in the past.\n\nIf you do even conservative sum of the parts math, you’re talking about several billion in value outside of the core cloud business. Right now, the market seems to be valuing Nebius almost purely as “AI cloud plus execution risk” and ignoring everything else. \n\nIf Nebius actually hits the target of  $7–9B ARR in 2026, you’re looking at a forward revenue multiple of roughly 2.4x for the core cloud business. While others easily have a multiple of 5-10. \n\n**- The real risks**  \nI don't want to turn a blind eye to the risk, because ofc there are:   \n\\- Data center build timelines slipping  \n\\- Customer concentration  \n\\- Share dilution over time\n\nAll real. But they are execution risks, not demand risks. Chance of execution is (in my opinion) the highest at Nebius compared to others, because of their former Yandex experience.   \n  \nThis all seems to good to be true to me, so please convince me if i'm missing something here. Even a base case should provide a valuation of roughly 120-150$ according to my research. \n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's hostile bid\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery urged shareholders on Wednesday to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, stating the offer posed “significant risks and costs” to the company while Netflix's earlier proposal held greater value.\n\nMultiple companies have previously competed for Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns numerous classic films including Casablanca and the Harry Potter series. On December 5, Netflix agreed to acquire a portion of Warner Bros. Discovery for $82.7 billion; Paramount Skydance Media Group followed suit on December 8, offering to acquire the entire media group for $30 per share in an all-cash deal.\n\nNetflix has agreed to acquire Warner Bros.' HBO and its streaming and studio businesses, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 per share.\n\nParamount Sky Dance CEO David Ellison called it “a superior all-cash offer” when proposing to acquire all shares of Warner Bros. Discovery. Ellison stated that merging Warner Bros. Discovery's assets with those of Paramount Sky Dance (parent company of CBS News) would facilitate regulatory approval.\n\nA Paramount Pictures spokesperson has not yet responded to requests for comment.\n\nWhy Warner Bros. Discovery Favors Netflix\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery advised shareholders to reject Paramount Pictures' offer, stating its board believes the regulatory risks of both acquisition proposals are comparable. The company also indicated its analysis found Netflix's proposal which includes cash and Netflix stock to be more advantageous.\n\nThis has also raised concerns about the $40.65 billion equity investment in Paramount Sky Dance Media. Warner Bros. Discovery responded by stating, “The Ellison family has made no investment commitment of any kind.” According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person with a net worth of $243 billion.\n\nShortly before WarnerMedia made its proposal, Affinity Partners one of Paramount Sky Dance's financial backers announced its withdrawal from the hostile takeover bid. Affinity is a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAn Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that while the firm still believes Paramount Sky Dance's acquisition proposal holds “strong strategic merit,” it decided to withdraw due to “significant shifts in investment dynamics since our initial participation in October.”\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, the Warner Bros. Discovery board stated it views Netflix as having superior financial health, higher credit ratings, and greater market capitalization.\n\nThe letter stated: “Netflix's merger is fully backed by a publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion and an investment-grade balance sheet.”\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery added that Paramount Sky Dance's credit rating “is at or just one notch above ‘junk’ status with two major rating agencies,” while its market capitalization stands at $15 billion.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery also expressed concerns about Paramount's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its acquisition offer.\n\n“The trust's assets and liabilities would not be publicly disclosed and could change,” it wrote in its letter to shareholders. “As the name implies, revocable trusts typically contain provisions allowing assets to be transferred at any time.”\n\nAlthough Wednesday's shareholder letter indicated that Paramount's acquisition offer is not favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide whether to accept Paramount's bid for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery, and TNT.\n\n",

Adjusted operating profit reached $6.42 billion, while cash flow from operating activities hit $8.41 billion  a stark contrast to the $3.24 billion recorded in the same period last year.\n\nAnalysts had previously forecast EPS of $3.95 and revenue of $12.95 billion.\n\nSanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Micron, stated: ‘In our fiscal first quarter, Micron achieved record revenue with significant margin improvements across the company and all business segments.’ ‘Our outlook for the second quarter indicates significant record-setting levels for revenue, gross margin, earnings per share and free cash flow, with business performance expected to strengthen further throughout fiscal 2026.

      "content": "Kushner just dipped from the WBD bid mess does anything really change?\n\nI’ve been watching the Warner Bros situation, and it’s starting to feel like one of those cases where the headlines are louder than the fundamentals, except now the headlines have turned into an actual bidding war.\n\nThe latest development is pretty straightforward. Jared Kushner’s PE firm, Affinity Partners, has pulled its financing support from Paramount Skydance’s hostile bid. From what’s been reported, it was only about a $200M check in the grand scheme of things, but it still mattered. It wasn’t a big piece of the financing, but it was a politically connected name, and that backing is now gone. (News source, if you’re interested: [Netflix CEOs Defend WBD Buy, Pivot To Theaters.](https://www.moneyai-app.com/share/session?shareUuid=bf87e276-0fb9-4408-a192-da2a4daf64f3))\n\nNetflix already has an agreed deal to buy WBD at $27.75 per share, or roughly $72B. Paramount Skydance countered with a $30 per share all cash hostile offer aimed directly at shareholders. The reporting so far suggests WBD’s board is leaning toward sticking with Netflix rather than engaging with the hostile bid.\n\nWhat makes this situation feel unusual to me is that non financial factors are wrapped around the deal.\n\nParamount’s bid comes with big name backers, but it also brings political baggage. The CBS and Trump comments have pulled the deal into the public spotlight, which can slow the process down even if the headline price looks higher on paper.\n\nWBD’s Q3 2025 release showed about $9.0B in revenue, down excluding FX. The market has been watching whether improvements in streaming profitability can continue to offset the decline in linear networks, especially with the debt load still hanging over the company. That’s why Affinity walking away doesn’t really change how I read the situation. It hurts the optics of the hostile bid, but it doesn’t suddenly make the Netflix deal look worse, or make the underlying tradeoffs any simpler.",

I’m that boring long-term investor who buys strong companies with real fundamentals when they’re trading at a discount, then just… sits there… like a fossil… and watches compounding do its thing.\n\nMy style is:\n\t•\tFind great businesses (especially tech / AI / “the future is now” stuff)\n\t•\tBuy when they’re discounted\n\t•\tRarely sell\n\t•\tLet time + fundamentals bully the market into agreeing with me\n\nAnd honestly? That’s worked really well for me over the years. Good to great results. Compounding is undefeated if you stop touching it.\n\nThen this year I decided to “explore.”\nSpecifically: Bitcoin world.\n\nSo I bought IBIT (yes, the ETF, also basically the only ETF I hold). That part? Actually went fine. I made good success there. Smooth. Simple. “I’m a genius” vibes.\n\nThen my brain said the most dangerous phrase in personal finance:\n\n“What if I try options?”\n\nNow, I’ve always been reluctant. I’ve seen enough blown-up accounts to know this movie ends badly. But I tried with a small portion “just to learn.”\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nI made a bit of money.\n\nAnd that’s when the market gave me the first hit for free like a professional dealer.\n\nI got hooked by the small wins. I started thinking:\n\t•\t“Okay I get it now.”\n\t•\t“This is easy.”\n\t•\t“Why doesn’t everyone do this?”\n\t•\t“I should size up.”\n\nSo I sized up.\n\nAnd now I’m here to report that I have officially donated ~$55,000 USD to the Options Liquidity &amp; Emotional Damage Foundation.\n\nMost of it was from:\n\t•\tIBIT options\n\t•\tMicroStrategy (MSTR) options\n\nTo be clear: I’m not crying out loud.\n(…I mean, spiritually I am. But publicly? I’m being mature. Very demure. Very mindful.)\n\nI’m not here to say “don’t trade” or “options are evil.”\nMaybe you have the right skill set, discipline, risk management, and emotional control. Maybe you’ve got a real edge.\n\nBut me?\n\nI’ve realized something very important:\n\nTrading isn’t for me. Options definitely aren’t for me.\n\nBecause I’m wired for investing. I’m wired for fundamentals. I’m wired for time in the market, not adrenaline in the bloodstream.\n\nThis year was:\n\t•\tA great year for my long-term investing philosophy\n\t•\tAnd also a terrible year where I lost ~$55k in options in a single year\n\nSo yeah. Harsh lesson. Expensive tuition. But I’m taking it as a bite of learning, not a life sentence.\n\nIf you’re reading this and you’re currently in the “small wins -&gt; bigger size -&gt; confidence -&gt; pain” phase… just know: you’re not alone. The slope is slippery, and the market has excellent aim.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading.\nI’m going back to buying good companies at discounts and letting compounding do what it does best.",

I know we should not try to time the market but I am wondering if now is a good time to buy with many stocks being down 30-50% over the past week. Most of these were at their ATH a few months ago, and I’ve been patiently sitting and waiting for a good opportunity to get into the market and not buy in while most stocks were at their ATH’s.\n\nI am middle class, make about 80K annually, have about 50K in cash to my name and I wanted to buy 10K each in stocks in different sectors that seem to be down heavily right now.\n\nTech: 10K in GOOG, which today crossed under the $300 for the first time in a while.\n\n10K in Meta which is around $650 now.\n\nAerospace: 10K in RKLB, trading around $50 down from its ATH a few months back around $70.\n\nSpace and Satellite: ASTS which was trading at $100 just a little over a month ago and is now down to $60.\n\nMaterials: MP Materials which is trading around  $50 down from $100 a few months ago.\n\nI guess my question is if now is a good time to buy or if we anticipate the market to continue plummeting in the coming weeks. I would hate to lose half my investment 1 month into it and spend the next year trying to break even. I would like to hold for 1-2 years, just being honest, as I don’t think I have the patience or the capital to completely let this go of this money for 30+ years. Thanks for your help and feedback in advance. Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this. I know this sub is heavily focused on fundamentals, PE ratios, etc. and I am simply not knowledgeable enough to contribute any meaningful DD so I’m just going based off my very elementary and probably naive knowledge.\n\nThanks for your time and help in your responses.",

Secure a contract at a loss -&gt; \n\n2. Use contract to get a loan/funding -&gt; \n\n3. Build out infrastructure/acquire GPUs -&gt; \n\n4. Repeat -&gt; \n\n5. Hope to eventually become a competing AWS alternative for AI cloud solutions.\n\nThe problem: \n\nToday, the overwhelming majority of NBIS's revenue comes from hyper scalers looking to offload demand. NBIS is providing them the compute at a loss. \n\nAt anytime a hyperscaler(s) can choose to no longer use NBIS when unfavorable, which will completely cripple the company's finances.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are currently investing extremely heavily into their own data centers to keep up with demand, so the chance of Nebius acquiring customers that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, can't provide supply to in the future is low.\n\nThere is also huge uncertainty regarding NBIS's future cashflows, demand, and financial solvency. Shareholders may unknowingly be diluted to raise funds, a forced buy-out can happen, etc.\n\nOverall, NBIS is a great opportunity to become a generational bag holder. Simply ignore the financials and choose to invest off of vibes, chasing hype, etc., and you may potentially find yourself holding a bag for years to come.",

      "content": "Labor Warnings for the Stock Market\n\nThe unemployment print this week was higher than expected and is signaling an upward trend in unemployment.  Historically, the Sahm indicator has been used as a confirmation tool for \"recession\" (I use quotes because I feel the term has become more and more ambiguous in recent years) and is a measure of how unemployment is trending.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the Sahm indicator--It looks at the unemployment moving average.  Fundamentally, it takes a look at the lowest 3-month moving average over a 12-month period (currently about \\~4.2%) and compares it to the most recent 3-month moving average.  Essentially, if the current 3-month moving average is .50% (50 bps) higher than the 3-month moving average low, it produces a confirmation signal of \"recession\" with no historical false positives. \n\nThe current moving average of unemployment is \\~4.43% which puts us north of 20 bps toward the signal.  If the January 9th print is anything higher than 4.7%, there will be real concerns about the state of the economy (will put unemployment moving average at about \\~40 bps above  the moving average low).  As of today's (12/17) price action, it looks like the market is pricing in the possibility of an accelerating unemployment trend that could continue in January's print.  The Fed recently cut rates which may help reduce firing rates as cost saving measures, but January's unemployment print will be critical in understanding where the economy is at and likely where the stock market will go next.  \n\nTL;DR--If unemployment print on 1/9/26 &gt;4.7%, risk off.  If less than, likely a neutral to risk on shift.  ",

Between the ups and downs of the AI hype cycle, the volatility in crypto, and the broader market swings, I’ve had to adjust my strategy more than once.\n\nIf I had to pick one lesson that stood out, it would be this: I really underestimated the importance of cash management and balanced allocation. There were times I was too aggressive or too concentrated, and it hurt. Looking back, I wish I had focused more on building a portfolio that is steady over the long term but flexible enough to adapt when needed.\n\nCurious to hear from others. What was the most important lesson you learned this year, whether it’s about strategy, mindset, or a specific event that changed your thinking?",

      "content": "What’s the most persistent problem you ran into while building your business and how did you finally fix it?\n\nEvery founder I’ve met has that one annoying problem that just would not go away, the kind that quietly drains your time, energy, and sanity until you eventually crack the code. \n\nFor some people it’s hiring, for others it’s consistency, product-market fit, cash flow, whatever. So I’m genuinely curious: what was the most stubborn pain point in your startup journey, and what finally solved it for you? For me, the one thing that stuck around way longer than it should have was multi-account management. \n\nI run several niche pages as part of my business model, and juggling them was honestly way harder than building the business itself. Logging in/out constantly, mixing up accounts, browser fingerprints acting weird, random lockouts... I wasted so much time trying to manage everything manually that it actually slowed down the rest of my work. I finally solved it by building a proper setup with a few tools. The foundation is AdsPower, mostly because it lets me keep each account in its own clean browser environment without stepping on each other. On top of that, I pair it with Buffer for queued posts so I’m not scrambling all day. That combo basically removed 90% of the stress. And if anyone else is dealing with the same headache: Adspower currently has a code (reddittry) that gives you 10 new IP environments for free, which is worth testing before committing. \n\nSo what was yours? What problem kept haunting you even after you thought you’d solved it - and what finally made it click?",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Time Horizon:** Day | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-17 21:32:23  \n**Overall Market Sentiment:** **Bearish with Elevated Anxiety**\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Bearish with Elevated Anxiety**\nThe confluence of data points to a risk-off environment dominated by negative catalysts and retail disillusionment.\n*   **Reddit Sentiment:** Overwhelmingly negative. Top discussions highlight \"exit liquidity\" cynicism, specific stock declines (ORCL, ASML, NVDA), and broader economic pessimism (jobs, household wealth). The sharp decline in SOL trader activity suggests a retail pullback from risk assets.\n*   **Market Data:** Key tech bellwether **NVDA is down -3.81%**, a significant single-day move that validates the negative sentiment. The **VIX at 16.48** indicates rising, though not panicked, fear.\n*   **Macro Backdrop:** A **10Y Treasury Yield of 4.15%** and **Fed Funds at 3.64%** reflect a still-restrictive monetary policy environment, pressuring growth valuations. The elevated Unemployment Rate (4.6%) adds to the gloomy picture.\n\n---\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES: Across All Sources**\n1.  **AI & Tech Infrastructure Stress Test:** The \"AI trade\" is facing a reality check. News of Oracle's data center financing snag and ASML's dip on China EUV news, paired with Reddit's \"exit liquidity\" narrative, show cracks in the AI infrastructure theme. This is confirmed by NVDA's sharp decline.\n2.  **Earnings & Guidance Divergence:** Micron's positive report contrasts with broader tech weakness, suggesting a stock-specific, fundamentals-driven market where even good news may not lift the sector.\n3.  **Political & Macroeconomic Uncertainty:** Discussions on Trump's jobs promise and the \"Warrior Dividend\" headline, alongside concerns over household wealth, point to heightened sensitivity to fiscal policy and economic resilience.\n4.  **Geopolitical & Regulatory Crosscurrents:** China's reported EUV progress (ASML) and Hong Kong exchange changes are reminders of persistent geopolitical and regulatory risks.\n5.  **Retail Retreat & Meme Stock Nostalgia:** The collapse in SOL activity and posts referencing Burry and GME indicate a contraction in speculative retail trading, with a nostalgic look back at past manias.\n\n---\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Immediate Negative Catalyst:** The **Oracle (ORCL) news** is a significant signal. A reported $10B data center financing snag is hitting a major AI/cloud player, raising concerns about capital expenditure sustainability and debt levels in the sector.\n*   **Contrarian Signal:** **Micron (MU)** blowing out earnings is a positive signal for memory/hardware, potentially indicating underlying AI demand remains strong, but it's being overshadowed by broader sentiment.\n*   **Liquidity Signal:** The extreme moves in low-volume, micro-cap stocks (ATPC, YCBD, VYNE) alongside major tech selling suggest unstable, thin market conditions—a warning sign.\n*   **Macro Signal:** The **South African news** (lower inflation target, potential 2026 rally) is a fringe but notable signal of shifting central bank policies in emerging markets, which could presage similar discussions in developed markets later.\n\n---\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n**Primary Risks:**\n1.  **Sector Rotation Risk:** The AI/tech sector, a major market leader, is showing vulnerability. A sustained sell-off could trigger broader market de-risking.\n2.  **Retail Sentiment Risk:** The disillusionment and withdrawal of retail traders (per SOL data) remove a source of market liquidity and speculative support, potentially amplifying downside moves.\n3.  **Idiosyncratic Financing Risk:** The Oracle story highlights that high debt costs and financing hurdles are becoming material obstacles for corporate growth plans.\n4.  **Political Policy Risk:** Announcements like the \"Warrior Dividend\" introduce uncertainty regarding fiscal policy, inflation, and market direction.\n\n**Primary Opportunities:**\n1.  **Selective Value in Tech:** Strong fundamental performers like **Micron (MU)** may be oversold due to sector-wide sentiment, creating a potential entry point.\n2.  **Defensive Rotation:** Investors may rotate towards sectors less sensitive to interest rates and AI hype.\n3.  **Volatility Premium:** Elevated VIX and single-stock volatility (see ORCL, ASML) present opportunities for options sellers to capture premium, albeit with high risk.\n\n---\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**WATCHLIST & ACTIONS:**\n\n*   **ORCL (Oracle):** **Monitor for debt market reaction and management guidance.** The 4% dip is a direct response to a reported financing issue. Watch for official company response and credit default swap (CDS) spreads. A failure to quickly resolve this could signal wider problems in tech capex financing.\n*   **MU (Micron Technology):** **Consider as a potential counter-trend long.** Its positive earnings are a stark contrast to sector weakness. If it holds support despite NVDA's drop, it demonstrates resilience and could lead a rebound in semiconductor hardware names.\n*   **SECTOR: Semiconductor Equipment (ASML, AMAT, LRCX):** **Exercise caution.** The ASML dip on China EUV news is a reminder of the sector's geopolitical sensitivity and valuation risk. Avoid new long positions until the sector stabilizes.\n*   **SECTOR: AI Infrastructure & Cloud:** **Reduce exposure / tighten stops.** The \"exit liquidity\" narrative on Reddit is a potent sentiment indicator. Combined with the ORCL news, this theme is under pressure. Favor companies with strong balance sheets and clear near-term profitability.\n*   **MACRO: U.S. Treasury Yields (^TNX):** **Watch for a break below 4.10%.**\n    A sustained move down could indicate a flight to safety that temporarily relieves pressure on growth stocks, but would also signal deeper economic concerns.\n*   **RISK GAUGE: VIX (Volatility Index):** **A close above 18** would confirm an escalation in fear and likely precede a broader market decline. Use this as a signal to de-risk portfolios further.\n\n**SUMMARY:** The market is in a corrective phase led by a shaken AI/tech complex. Retail sentiment has turned sour. **The immediate playbook is defensive: reduce beta, raise cash, and wait for volatility to subside.** The key near-term watch is whether the Oracle incident is isolated or the first of several financing-related stumbles. Opportunities exist only for selective, fundamentally-driven positions, not thematic bets.",

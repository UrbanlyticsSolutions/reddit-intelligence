      "content": "U.S. crude oil drops below $55 a barrel, hits lowest level since early 2021\n\nOil has been under steady pressure this year, and it doesn’t seem to be coming from just one factor. OPEC+ has been adding supply back into the market faster than many expected after years of disciplined output cuts, and that extra production is starting to show up in inventories and price action. At the same time, the geopolitical risk premium that supported crude over the past couple of years is slowly deflating. Markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, or at least a less volatile outlook, which reduces fears around supply disruptions tied to the conflict.\nPut together, it’s a tough setup for oil bulls: more barrels coming online while the “fear bid” fades. Demand hasn’t collapsed, but it hasn’t been strong enough to absorb the new supply without pressure on prices. Curious how others are thinking about this is this just a cyclical oversupply phase, or does it mark a longer period of capped oil prices if geopolitics cool and OPEC+ prioritizes volume over price?\n\n Source :\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/crude-oil-prices-today.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "title": "Why Dr. Burry can’t talk about swaps, FTDs, or “the plumbing”  and why that silence actually matters",
      "content": "Why Dr. Burry can’t talk about swaps, FTDs, or “the plumbing”  and why that silence actually matters\n\n1. What Burry didn’t say (and why people noticed) A lot of people reacted to Burry’s post by saying:\n\nHe didn’t mention swaps\n\nHe didn’t mention FTDs\n\nHe didn’t talk about the buy button\n\nHe didn’t reference the $80+ run with RK’s disclosed position\n\nHe didn’t disclose his current position\n\nAt face value, that looks STRANGE, especially if you’ve been following GME CLOSELY. But this assumes Burry is just another Twitter commentator.\n\nHe’s not.\n\n2. There’s a hard legal line between “opinion” and “allegation”\n\nTalking about:\n\nvaluation\n\nbalance sheets\n\ncapital allocation\n\npatience\n\nincentives\n\n\\-&gt; legal, protected financial opinion\n\nTalking about:\n\npersistent FTDs implying non-delivery\n\nswaps being used to hide short exposure\n\nprice suppression through settlement mechanics\n\nbrokers/clearing houses failing to deliver shares\n\n\\-&gt;implicit allegations of market manipulation or settlement failure\n\nThat’s not commentary. That’s accusation.\n\nOnce a hedge fund manager publicly connects:\n\nspecific stock + settlement failures + identifiable MECHANISMS they expose themselves to:\n\nSEC inquiries\n\nsubpoenas\n\ndiscovery\n\naccusations of market signaling or manipulation\n\nBurry already lived through this once after 2008. He knows exactly where that line is.\n\n3. Why FTDs are especially radioactive\n\nReported short interest:\n\nis self-reported\n\nnetted\n\ndelayed\n\nlegally sanitized\n\nFTDs are different:\n\nthey are hard settlement failures\n\nthey show up after the trade\n\nthey imply that someone sold something they didn’t deliver on time\n\nPublicly tying persistent FTDs to price behavior is essentially saying: “Someone cannot or will not deliver shares they sold.”\n\nThat’s not something a regulated fund manager can casually TWEET. Retail can talk about it. Analysts can speculate. Dr. Burry cannot.\n\n4. Why he talks about time instead of price\n\nIf Burry believed, “this resolves via a quick squeeze”  he’d say nothing.\n\nIf Burry believed, “this is immediate fraud” he’d stay silent.\n\nInstead, he emphasized:\n\npatience\n\noptionality\n\ncapital discipline\n\nbalance sheet strength\n\nThat framing only makes sense if:\n\npressure exists\n\nit is being actively managed\n\nresolution depends on time, not a single event\n\nFTDs, swaps, and synthetic exposure are time-based problems. They don’t explode instantly, they compound.\n\nThat’s the subtext.\n\n5. Why GameStop’s cash position matters more than people think (not apes 😁)\n\nHolding cash is often mocked as “doing nothing.”\n\nIn reality:\n\ncash removes bankruptcy risk\n\ncash denies shorts their best exit\n\ncash preserves optionality\n\nIf you believe there is structural short exposure, then: Not deploying capital prematurely is rational.\n\nWhy pull the trigger on the only hostage you have left?\n\nBurry highlighting patience isn’t passive, it’s strategic.\n\n6. Silence ≠ ignorance\n\nThe idea that Dr. Michael Burry an seasoned investor capable of getting large investment banks to write him custom TRS contracts​, understands swaps, understands FTDs, understands incentives …but somehow “forgot” to mention them publicly …is far less believable than the idea that he can’t mention them.\n\nHis post isn’t for retail hype, It’s for people who already understand how this works.\n\n7. The tell: what everyone avoids saying out loud\n\nNotice who else never speaks directly about:\n\nnaked shorts\n\nswaps\n\nFTDs\n\nRyan Cohen. Roaring Kitty. Michael Burry.\n\nDifferent people. Same silence.\n\nThat’s not coincidence. That’s legal reality.\n\nConclusion\n\nBurry’s post wasn’t incomplete, it was bounded. He said what he legally could:\n\npatience\n\ncapital structure\n\ntime\n\nEverything else swaps, FTDs, settlement stress is left for readers to infer. In markets like this, what isn’t said matters more than what is. And silence, in this case, isn’t weakness.\n\nIt’s self-preservation.\n\nTL;DR Michael Burry didn’t “miss” swaps, FTDs, or market structure issues in his recent comments on GameStop. He can’t talk about them without inviting a legal and regulatory nightmare. What he did say about patience, capital structure, and time is the maximum signal he can legally send.\n\nLooking forward to part2 💎👐\n\nNote this is not a Burry fluff piece I'm just sharing my humble thoughts on what I think this implies. I love the fact that the big short OG is talking about my Favorite company after all these years. The saga continues.\n\n  \nThanks to... banana-in-my-anus for the contribution 😀",

      "content": "Tesla stock hits record as Wall Street rallies around robotaxi hype despite slow EV sales\n\nTesla’s stock just set a new record, breaking past its previous all-time high from almost exactly a year ago. The rally comes after a wild 12 months for shareholders including a brutal 36% drop in Q1, the stock’s worst quarterly performance since 2022. What’s driving the rebound now seems to be renewed optimism around Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi vision. Investors appear to be betting that Tesla can finally convert its existing fleet of EVs into autonomous, revenue-generating vehicles, rather than treating autonomy as a distant concept. Still, it’s hard to ignore how quickly sentiment has flipped. From heavy losses early in the year to record highs now, Tesla remains one of the most emotion-driven names in the market.\nDo you see this move as confidence in real progress on autonomy, or just another sentiment-driven Tesla cycle?\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/tesla-stock-hits-record-on-robotaxi-hype-despite-drop-in-ev-sales.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "content": "TSLA's epic surge: With its core business collapsing, why did its stock price reach a new all-time high of $491.5?\n\nTSLA surged against the market trend today, reaching a new all-time high of $491.5, while Elon Musk's net worth soared to over $670 billion.  This stands in stark contrast to the company's core business struggles, including a nearly 40% drop in European sales and institutional forecasts of declining Q4 deliveries. The truth is: Wall Street has completely abandoned fundamental analysis of TSLA's automotive business. They are making a massive gamble that Musk will successfully transform into the core of an AI empire $1.6 trillion market capitalization is just the beginning. What they truly value is the $1 trillion profit potential of the FSD software, the multi-trillion-dollar market for CyberCab and Optimus robots by 2026, and the epic narrative of the SpaceX space economy behind it all. This high-risk gamble, which completely ties personal wealth, grand narratives, and extreme valuations together, means that TSLA is a bet that will either reach $3 trillion or see its dreams shattered.\n\nAt this point, would you buy at a high price, or would you wait and see?",

      "content": "Nasdaq moves to make trading nearly 24 hours. Why some on Wall Street say that’s a bad idea\n\nNasdaq says it plans to file with the SEC to allow U.S. stocks and ETFs to trade almost around the clock, five days a week, starting as early as the second half of 2026. The proposal would stretch trading to 23 hours per weekday, splitting the market into a long “day session” (4 a.m.–8 p.m. ET), a one-hour pause, and an overnight session (9 p.m.–4 a.m.). Supporters argue this just formalizes what already exists in crypto and futures, and better serves global investors who don’t operate on U.S. time zones. Critics aren’t convinced. Concerns center on thinner liquidity during overnight hours, bigger price swings, and whether constant trading would amplify short-term speculation rather than improve price discovery.\nCurious how others see this. Is nearly nonstop equity trading the natural next step, or does it risk creating more volatility without real benefits for long-term investors?\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/nasdaq-moves-to-near-24-hour-trading-some-say-thats-a-bad-idea.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

At this point, it’s the only player running large-scale, fully driverless commercial services in multiple cities, which gives it a meaningful real-world data advantage. Amazon’s Zoox is taking a different approach, starting with limited public access. It’s begun offering free driverless rides around parts of the Las Vegas Strip and select San Francisco neighborhoods, signaling confidence in its tech but still moving cautiously. Tesla has entered the conversation with a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the Bay Area, but as of mid-December those vehicles still rely on human drivers or safety supervisors. That puts Tesla more in a pilot phase than true autonomy for now.\nOverall, the gap between “driverless demos” and fully autonomous, scaled operations is becoming clearer. Waymo looks firmly in front today, while Zoox and Tesla are progressing just on very different timelines and risk profiles.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/waymo-amazon-zoox-tesla-robotaxi-expansion.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

In 2023 it jumped to $2+, and now it’s close to $4.\n\nMeanwhile, stores like Aldi and Lidl still seem significantly more cost-effective for many grocery staples.\n\nWalmart’s entire brand has always been built around “everyday low prices,” but lately it doesn’t feel like that’s actually true anymore.\n\nHas anyone else compared prices recently?

Discovery's board of directors may announce its decision on Paramount Sky Dance's $108.4 billion acquisition offer as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. The board is expected to recommend shareholders vote against the bid.\n\nThe renewed acceptance of Netflix's acquisition offer marks the latest development in this bidding war. The target of this contest includes Warner Bros.' storied film and television studio, along with its vast library of movies and TV shows a portfolio spanning classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to contemporary hits such as Harry Potter and Friends, as well as the HBO and HBO Max streaming services.\n\nA Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe winner will gain a significant advantage in the streaming wars by securing a vast content library that has long been a target for acquisition.\n\nEarlier this month, Netflix ultimately prevailed in its $27 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Warner Bros.' non-cable assets.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison subsequently made a direct, all-cash $30-per-share takeover bid to Warner Bros. shareholders.\n\nParamount stated in filings submitted to regulators that its acquisition proposal is superior to Netflix's bid and more likely to secure regulatory approval. Paramount's acquisition plan consists of $41 billion in new equity backed by the Ellison family and Redbird Capital, along with $54 billion in debt financing commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo Global Management.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Affinity Partners, a firm owned by Jared Kushner and one of Paramount Pictures' financing partners, will withdraw from the competition.\n\nParamount Pictures and Affinity Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.",

Basics/Getting Started)\n\nThis famed short-seller explains why he’s doubling down on his bet against data centers\n\nJim Chanos says the money will come from what the chips produce, not where they reside\n\nBy Barbara Kollmeyer\n\nInvestors continue to push doubts to the surface over AI bets paying off into year-end.\n\n \nAmong those with strong views on that theme is prominent investment manager Jim Chanos, best known for past short selling bets on Enron and Tesla. In a podcast interview with Monetary Matters with Jack Farley, Chanos discussed why he thinks dot-com bust 2.0 could be coming as he explained one bearish bet he’s doubling down on.\n \n\nThe investor placed a big short bet on legacy data centers in 2022, describing the old cloud data center business as “crummy,” with a “very low return on capital business, highly capital intensive.”\n \n\nChanos said he’s even less convinced on the newest version of data centers — those that host GPUs, or rent out computing power to AI companies. “It’s basically a commodity business, particularly as everybody’s building them. And our view to clients has been the magic and the money is going to come from what the chips produce ultimately, not where they reside,” he said.\n\n \nInvestors wanting to make AI bets should stick to pure AI titans like OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, or hyperscalers, he said. “But investing in bitcoin miners that are converting to data center companies or me-too companies that are jumping on the so-called neoclouds, which are basically just landlords, to me seems problematic for two reasons,” he said.\n\n\n**Chanos mentioned CoreWeave CRWV by name while bitcoin miners-turned-data-center companies include Iren IREN and Cipher Mining CIFR.**\n \n\nThe first is that hosting GPUs is a low -margin, low-return on capital business, and the second is any data center buying the GPUs themselves must be making a bet on depreciation, he said. Chanos’ own estimate is that those GPUs could end up obsolete or not fast enough for clients within five years. Hedge fund founder Harris Kupperman and “Big Short” investor Michael Burry have also delivered strong warnings on GPU depreciation.\n \n\n**Chanos said that among the big hyperscalers building out their data centers — such as Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Oracle ORCL and Amazon AMZN — the first two will be able to finance that from their cash flows, but the rest “will need external financing.”**\n \n\nThe overriding AI bet is the technology will hit an inflection point in 2027 or 2028 and profits will flow. Oracle and Amazon have shown an inability thus far to monetize those big investments in AI, equipment, hardware and locations, and that’s one reason he’s short on Oracle.\n \n\n \n\nHe added that many big hyperscalers want to get the data-center business off their own balance sheets and just lease from someone else. “The bet is you’re buying these things and leasing them out and that five or six years is actually too conservative, you’ll be able to earn money on them for 10 or 12 years,” he said.\n \n\nChanos said the data-center world is going to shrink as just a handful will be needed and makes the scenario look “a lot like 1999 and 2000.”\n \n\nHe warns that a credit crunch or pullback in sentiment such as seen the early 2000s would see a lot of that spending by those companies drop fairly fast. “The risk levels for all these companies are much higher than they were five or 10 years ago,” he said.\n\nFIN\n\n\nThe pod cast article is here\n\nhttps://trkmw.dowjones.com/click/43066481.216328/aHR0cHM6Ly9wb2RjYXN0cy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvcG9kY2FzdC90aGUtYWktZGF0YS1jZW50ZXItc2hvcnQtamltLWNoYW5vcy1vbi1vcmFjbGUtZGF0YS9pZDE3NjkwOTM5MDY_aT0xMDAwNzQxMzk3NTc0Jm1vZD1kamVtX213bm5lZWR0b2tub3c/6776e8dd2719be24a983dc02Bc8498078\n\n\n———\n\n*My comment:*\n\nCharlie Munger said that the biggest mistake a person can make is not learning from others and only want to learn from their own mistakes, because this time it is different.\n\nMichael Burry and Jim Chanos might be early but they are not usually wrong. Mock them at your own peril. \n\n",

Discovery is preparing to advise its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance’s hostile takeover bid, with a formal recommendation expected as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount’s proposal valued Warner Bros. Discovery at roughly $108 billion in an all-cash offer, or about $30 per share, but board members have expressed concerns over the offer’s financing, structure and overall terms compared with other strategic options. The board appears inclined to recommend the company’s existing deal with Netflix which combines cash and stock and focuses on core studio and streaming assets as a more secure and valuable path forward for shareholders.\n\nThe market has reacted to the escalating deal drama, with Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock weakening as news of the planned rejection circulated. Investors are watching closely as Paramount’s bid backed in part by funding from equity and debt partners faces internal resistance, and as other players like Netflix remain in contention. \n\nAlso, Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners has reportedly exited the takeover battle, marking a shift in financing participation for the Paramount bid. Paramount still has time to revise or sweeten its offer before its tender deadline in early January, but Warner Bros. Discovery’s board seems poised to side with the alternative that they believe offers greater certainty and value for shareholders",

      "content": "Warner Bros likely to reject $108.4 billion Paramount bid, back Netflix in bidding war, sources say\n\nDecember 16 (Reuters) Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors may announce its decision on Paramount Sky Dance's $108.4 billion acquisition offer as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. The board is expected to recommend shareholders vote against the bid.\n\nThe renewed acceptance of Netflix's acquisition offer marks the latest development in this bidding war. The target of this contest includes Warner Bros.' storied film and television studio, along with its vast library of movies and TV shows a portfolio spanning classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to contemporary hits such as Harry Potter and Friends, as well as the HBO and HBO Max streaming services.\n\nA Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe winner will gain a significant advantage in the streaming wars by securing a vast content library that has long been a target for acquisition.\n\nEarlier this month, Netflix ultimately prevailed in its $27 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Warner Bros.' non-cable assets.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison subsequently made a direct, all-cash $30-per-share takeover bid to Warner Bros. shareholders.\n\nParamount stated in filings submitted to regulators that its acquisition proposal is superior to Netflix's bid and more likely to secure regulatory approval. Paramount's acquisition plan consists of $41 billion in new equity backed by the Ellison family and Redbird Capital, along with $54 billion in debt financing commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo Global Management.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Affinity Partners, a firm owned by Jared Kushner and one of Paramount Pictures' financing partners, will withdraw from the competition.\n\nParamount Pictures and Affinity Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.",

The last 10 years have been close, but BRK still pulled ahead.  \n\nWith Buffett stepping down and BRK being a very mature company now, can it still outperform $VOO over the next 10 years?  My thought is that active investing may actually start to outperform again.  Over 50% of fund flows are now into passive/indexing and there is risk of a bubble forming there.  This means when those passive funds nosedive hard, active investors with the cash can swoop in and buy their exaggerated lows.  Also, with the S&amp;P 500 extremely valued on so many metrics:  CAPE/Shiller P/E, Buffet Indicator (market cap-to-GDP), and regular P/E, I think return prospects won’t be very good over the next 10 years in U.S. stocks.  \n\nI like emerging markets, precious metals, and individual stocks more.  \n\nBut I think active investing may finally make a comeback too and beat passive with this setup.  If you HAD TO ONLY CHOOSE ONE, which would you rather hold:  BRK or VOO over the next 10 years.  You cannot sell the holding, nor invest in the other until 2035.  😋",

      "content": "Not Every Small Biotech Is Pre-Revenue, This One Already Sells Product\n\nThere is a reflex reaction in small-cap trading where people hear the word biotech and immediately assume no revenue and constant dilution. That shortcut breaks down when you actually look at SBFM.\n\nSunshine Biopharma currently carries a market cap around 6M, yet recent numbers point to more than 37M in annual revenue based on reported quarterly results and product sales. That alone separates it from the majority of Nasdaq biotechs in this range, many of which generate no commercial revenue at all.\n\nThis revenue is coming from approved generic drugs sold through its Canadian subsidiary, not from speculative trial assets. The company has been expanding its product lineup, which suggests ongoing execution rather than a stalled pipeline. That does not remove risk, but it changes the conversation.\n\nWhen a stock trades as if the business does not exist, even basic awareness can shift sentiment.

      "content": "Three Health Canada Approvals In A Row And The Market Still Treats It Like Nothing Changed\n\nWhat stands out here is not one headline. It is repetition.\n\n\n\nOver the last stretch, Sunshine Biopharma has cleared three separate Health Canada approvals through its Canadian subsidiary. Domperidone was approved, followed by doxycycline, and then Pravastatin. For a microcap pharma, clearing even one approval can take years. Clearing three in sequence points to a system that works, not a lucky break.\n\n\n\nEach of these products is a standard prescription generic with established demand. That matters because approvals translate directly into sellable inventory and recurring revenue, not distant milestones. This builds on an existing base where the company is already generating more than 37M in annual revenue per recent filings, while the entire market cap sits around 6 to 7M.\n\n\n\nDespite that, SBFM still trades near the 1 dollar range. That pricing suggests the market is either ignoring the approvals or assuming they do not matter financially. Historically, chains of approvals tend to matter more than isolated wins because they signal execution.\n\n\n\nDo your own research.\n\n",

The company owns two buildings in Roanoke, Indiana, with its 189,000 sq ft headquarters currently listed for a $29.5 million sale-leaseback at an 8.5% cap rate, and a 430,000 sq ft distribution center worth an estimated $15 to $20 million. Downside is further anchored by $82.9 million of inventory (down from $109.6 million YoY) plus $19 million in receivables, and the balance sheet sits at roughly breakeven with $10.7 million in cash versus $10.0 million drawn on its ABL facility.\n\nFund 1 Investments, owning 10% of shares with 20% economic exposure, filed a 13D in January 2025 agitating for a strategic review or sale, while new leadership under Executive Chairman Ian Bickley (ex-Coach) has launched his turnaround plan called \"Project Sunshine,\" delivered five consecutive months of positive comparable Brand channel sales, and hired a Chief Brand Officer from Tapestry's Coach division.\n\nEven without a turnaround, a sale of the headquarters alone would generate proceeds equal to roughly 50% of the current market cap, while a return to modest profitability (mid-single-digit EBIT margins on $250 million revenue) would imply $0.35 to $0.45 in EPS, which gives the stock at least 2x upside from here.\n\nA couple of directors also just bought a combined $600k of the stock, which is over 1% of the company, and the largest purchases ever for these insiders.\n\nClark Square Capital pitched the stock ([link](https://www.joinyellowbrick.com/sp/124984)) at the end of October (and is still bullish), and AstutexAI pitched it as a long in mid-November ([link](https://www.joinyellowbrick.com/sp/125721)). *Note: I'm not affiliated with either of them.*",

      "title": "It's Target's Time to Run (TGT)",
      "content": "It's Target's Time to Run (TGT)\n\nI invested in Target back in May at a price around 97.50, and I think it has momentum to make a really nice run in the beginning of 2026. I'm going to give the bear case first, then my case. I'm not using any AI, so I apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\n  \nThe Bear Case:\n\n1. **Bleeding customers/sales:** This is not good, and this is the biggest reason why the stock is down more than 60% from its high. Through the end of Q3, net sales are down 1.7% YOY. Traffic is down 2.2%. As a result, Target lowered their full-year EPS forecast from $7-$9 down to $7-$8. That means they're expecting to be less profitable than last year, when they earned $8.86 per share. There are other headwinds, but this is by far the biggest and most serious one. \n2. **Broader Economic Uncertainty**: Notice how the tech stocks have driven the gains in the market recently? That's because for the regular people, things aren't great. And if things aren't great for the regular people, then they don't shop at Target\n3. **DEI pushback:** This one hasn't been in the news as much recently, but there is still the occasional buzz about how Target rolled back its DEI policies and apparently kowtowed to Trump. I don't think this is a huge deal anymore, but it's still out there.\n4. **Walmart is eating Target's lunch:** There have been lots of articles recently like [this one](https://qz.com/walmart-prices-affluent-shoppers) talking about the progress Walmart has made with wealthier shoppers. Heck, my parents are in this group. My mom used to hate shopping at Walmart, but she's getting deliveries every week with Walmart+. Walmart stores have more cutesy displays and are generally less trashy than they were 5 years ago. When Walmart takes market share like this, guess who loses? Target\n5. **Corporate Layoffs:** Target also laid off 1000 corporate employees and is closing another 800 open positions, their biggest reduction in at least a decade. I don't hate this move, but it certainly didn't happen because times are good in Minneapolis.\n\nSo, why in the world am I still in Target? Here's why:\n\n1. **Hefty (and safe) dividend**: The dividend yield is currently at 4.7%, and they're due to hike it in a few quarters. Even if the turnaround takes some time, that drip will accumulate pretty quickly. The payout ratio is under 70%, so even with the current drop in sales, it'll take a while for that to really be in danger.\n2. **Share buybacks:** Target has $8.3 billion in share buybacks still authorized, and they've been buying. That's significant, especially at these bargain bin prices. So far, it seems like they've executed those perfectly.\n3. **New CEO:** The current COO, Brian Fiddelke, will take the reigns as the next Target CEO next year. He was the one who engineered the layoffs, showing that he's ready to make moves. Expectations for him literally couldn't be lower: When he was announced during Q2 earnings, the stock quickly dropped 15% to new 52-week lows. That's a lot of negative sentiment, and should be relatively easy to overcome. \n4. **Realistic turnaround plan:** So, what does Fiddelke want to do to save the company? Exactly what he should: Better, trendier merchandise; cleaner, shinier stores; and better tech and supply chain management. Ta-daa! That's exactly what they need to do, and it's already been paying off. As a personal anecdote, the Target nearest me was pretty dumpy a few months ago, with big, chaotic sale racks and disorganized everything. I went last weekend and it was 10 times cleaner, with more staff, better displays, and more customers. That place was packed and still looked good. But what's even more relevant is Target's numbers have actually improved since the disastrous Q1 earnings. Digital sales are up significantly, and total sales, earnings, and traffic declines have slowed. This ship *is* turning around, albeit slowly.\n5. **Cyclical rotations will benefit Target:** Eventually, the economy will turn around for the middle-class, which is the vast majority of Target's customers. Whether that happens in 2026 or not, it'll happen eventually. Also, we're in the middle of a huge rotation out of tech. The Dow is up, and the Nasdaq is down. Guess who's benefited from that? Target. The stock is up almost 20% from it's 5-year low almost a month ago, and it has plenty of room to run. The more AI falls, the more safer stocks like Target benefit.\n6. **Limited downside:** Unless Target's earnings fall off a cliff next year, that dividend is safe. With that, there's a pretty firm bottom to how low the stock can go. If things continue to go badly, it could drop to 75-80, but at some point that fat yield would keep it from dropping more.\n\nSo here are all the catalysts that could lead to a bumper Q1 earnings call: New CEO optimism, corporate cost-cutting paying off, continued share buybacks, an expected hike to an already hefty dividend, cyclical rotations out of tech, a turnaround plan that's actually working, and continued digital growth. They're also still profitable, and still opening new stores. Of course, this isn't a risk-free play: Tariff costs are still up in the air and could deal a big blow in Q4 not just to Target, but to the whole retail sector as they eat the costs to keep market share. And if the economy continues to suffer, so will Target. But, if Target shows any signs of life, this thing will shoot up pretty quickly. I think Q1 earnings could be that catalyst:  Q1 was truly dreadful in 2025, and if they can beat those numbers in 2026 even modestly, it'll be some serious momentum for the stock with a new CEO at the helm.\n\n  \nTLDR: New CEO, cyclical rotations out of tech, crazy low expectations, and a turnaround plan that's actually working will send Target up 30% after Q1 earnings in 2026.",

You can measure this against other currencies, or bitcoin or any metric. We are printing money and growing out debt and inflation is happening and will continue to happen.\n\nSo rich people need to hedge against this. Gold is up 114% and silver 116% in the last years. At the same time, Bitcoin is up 104%. Real estate fairly flat (after double digit gains in 2021 and 2022) but still. up around 6-8% over the same time period. SPY is up 46.4% over the same time period.\n\nSo when all assets are up, and inflation is up, its not just performance driving the price.\n\nAmong these asset classes, the stock market the best combination of liquid, tax-favorable, legal and safe. No one puts their 401k in gold, bitcoin is quasi legal still and real estate is very illiquid. What Obama learned and then Biden and Trump is that stonks needs to always go up.

The wealthiest 10% own 50% of the stock market and they need to keep their wealth compounding to keep their donations flowing. \\*\\*We will print money, we will take part ownership in companies, we will buy bad loans, we literally do fking anything other than let the stock market go down.\\*\\*\n\nNow here's the question: What IS the stock market? Typically the largest and wealthiest funds take giant stakes in Blue chip companies and broad based ETS. But what do you do when automation/stagflation is muting dividends and small returns of mature industrials and the Mag7 hot tech stocks represent 35% of the entire S&amp;P.\n\nIf you're say a president who's obsessed with the stock market, and is known for transactional dealings and favorable deals to friends, and you want to keep the stock market afloat, what is easier - to keep buoying a small number of really big stocks or try and do an FDR style new deal to drive the engine of commerce and lift all boats with a rising tide? It's waaaay easier to just say \"Hey Jensen, hey Elon, lets make these deals\".\n\nIf you're a crony with money, whose entire wealth and livelihood depends on your assets under management increasing, same question. Now if you two team up together? Institutional fund diamond hands means government contracts and favorable tax deals.\n\n**It's all a long way of saying Tesla (and Mag7 broadly) have become too big too fail**. If we bailed out fucking Ford and GM because of auto jobs in detroit you can bet your ass we will bail out every Americans 401k, all of which rely on Mag7. The only reason the other companies in Mag7 haven't been exposed is that they actually increase profit and are worth the money. If tesla traded even at 2x the forward 12 month PE of its peers we'd see it lose 60% in market cap which would trigger a broad meltdown of the entire stock market and probably trigger a panic sell off.\n\n**\\*\\*So TL;DR -\\***\\* rich people need stocks to go up to keep their money safe from inflation. Telsa and Mag7 are needed to go up for this to happen, so the oligarchs and our government simply won't let them fail. Tesla is a store of value like bitcoin more than a stock that operates on fundamentals like P/E and earnings growth",

      "title": "Meta: Metaverse Cuts Are Not The Story. How It Affects AI Spend Is",
      "content": "Meta: Metaverse Cuts Are Not The Story. How It Affects AI Spend Is\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe reported cuts to the Reality Labs’ budget have likely been overstated. First, it is unclear how big the cuts are and which part of Reality Labs they affect. Will it just be VR and the Metaverse, or will augmented reality (smart glasses) be included? Reports are of 10% and 30% cuts. Again, how will this be spread out?\n\nIf we assume it is 30% of the entirety of Reality Labs, which I don’t believe. With expenses of \\~$16 billion, that would be over $4 billion in cuts. But remember, Meta is expected to have expenses in the range of $116-$118 billion in 2025, which will accelerate in 2026. $4 billion is not all that significant compared to the massive spend on AI.\n\nThis metaverse cut is not that big of a deal. What is important is what it tells us about the AI spend and Metas’ willingness to cut it back if needed. Therefore, I see two likely outcomes for Meta. One, Mark Zuckerberg will reduce spend in the face of weak demand for AI, or two, AI will be a success and the high spend will continue.\n\nDoing a discounted cash flow valuation on both cases, I find Meta to be good value in either scenario. I get a weighted valuation of $950.\n\nImage: Reality Labs Revenue And Expenses\n\nI wasn't able to add images, you can search the same title for my Substack post to see them. Oh, I had to take out the reference links as Reddit was auto-blocking the post, I think.\n\n# Zuckerberg's Willingness To Change\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s willingness to change should not have come as a massive surprise. There are multiple examples throughout Zuckerberg's career where he has shown this flexibility.\n\nIn 2008, he embraced advertising, something he had long had doubts about, brought in Cheryl Sandberg, and gave up a lot of operational control when it was felt they needed an ‘Adult in the room’.\n\nAround 2010, Zuckerberg was all in on Facebook being a web-based platform without the need for a dedicated app. When that was proven wrong, they pivoted. Before long, they had one of the most popular apps in the world.\n\nAnd of course, more recently, they went all in on the metaverse, even changing the name of the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021. Then, in the 2022 Q4 report, they announced the ‘year of efficiency’. I see last week's reports of cuts in the metaverse as a continuation of this change of direction.\n\nIt is this history that gives me, and I believe some of the market, faith that Zuckerberg can change direction if it becomes clear that the massive AI spend is not generating the desired returns.\n\n# Two Scenarios\n\nTo help me value the company, I found it useful to think of two scenarios and do separate valuations for each of them. Scenario 1, AI returns do not appear, and cuts in CapEx are needed. Scenario 2, AI leads to increased revenue.\n\n**Scenario 1: Cuts to AI spend**\n\nMeta has been quite clear that AI has given tangible benefits to their underlying business. Most analysts expect over 15% growth in the next 12 months. In this scenario, I'm going to assume it ends there. Algorithms are as optimised as they can get, there are no more efficiencies to find, and no new AI revenue sources appear.\n\nImage: DCF Model For Scenario 1: Reduced CapEx\n\nI am modelling revenue falling back to a still respectable 8%, which will then trail off to a terminal growth rate of 5%. This may seem high given a failed AI pivot, but keep in mind the underlying business is still dominant in the world of social media. Ad spend is still migrating to online, the world, especially outside the US, is getting richer, and there is no reason to think that Meta will not continue to grow for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs we discussed in his history, I believe Zuckerberg will pivot in the face of an AI failure and reduce Capex and spend. Barring any writedown, this will likely take a number of years as depreciation works its way through the books. I am modelling EBIT margin to rise from the current \\~40% to a terminal margin of 49%. And for the terminal reinvestment, I'm assuming a return on invested capital of 20%.\n\nImage: Final DCF Calculations\n\nPutting all these numbers together. I get a valuation of $861. So even in the scenario of a failed AI buildout, there is a case for Meta to be good value. With that said, it is easy to see the stock selling off in that situation, which could allow for an even more attractive entry.\n\n# Scenario 2: AI is moderately successful\n\nAI succeeding is such a general statement that it is very difficult to model. I will assume their revenues remain higher for longer as they continue to reap the rewards of AI, both in their core business and in any new business models that come from AI. I am modelling them to have 20% growth, trailing off to 15% in 4 years, and then trailing off to a terminal growth rate of 5.5%.\n\nImage: DCF Model For Scenario 2: AI Moderate Success\n\nTo support this growth, I am continuing the high CapEx spend, but with that said, I am assuming that the costs are front-loaded and relative to revenue, CapEx will actually fail. I am modelling this as EBIT margins remaining fairly steady, with a terminal rate of 37%. For the terminal reinvestment, I am assuming a return on invested capital of 15%.\n\nImage: Final DCF Calculations\n\nAdding all that up gets me to a valuation of $1,115. Of course, there is plenty of room in this 'AI moderate success' scenario for more upside. I see this as a conservative valuation.\n\n# Combining The Models\n\nWhen I do more than one valuation model, I like to get a weighted average between them, which means we have to give each scenario a likelihood.\n\nWhile I believe AI will be transformational, I'm not convinced Meta will be the one to build it. For that reason, I'm putting ‘reduced CapEx’ as the slightly more likely scenario and giving it a 65% weighting.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, if a company wants to be successful, it will need piles of money, abundant sources of data, and a willingness to go for it. Zuckerberg and Meta have all of that. I am putting a weighting of 35% on the ‘AI moderately successful’ scenario.\n\nImage: Weighted Average Calculation\n\nAI will succeed or fail. It is black or white, but I do like to work in the grey middle, so for my overall valuation, I will be using this weighted average of $950. \n\nGiven the different potential outcomes, it will be important to regularly update this model and my $950 valuation. For now, I am confident in placing a BUY target on the stock.\n\n# Risks\n\nZuckerberg has full control over Meta with his super-voting rights. And while in the past he's shown a willingness to change direction. A shareholder still has to accept that they are at the whims of one person. If he digs his heels in and says he will succeed in AI or take Meta down with him, there is not much we can do\n\nAs with any international company, there will be regulation and antitrust risk. From European Union fines to the Austrailian under 16 ban, there is a constant risk on this front.\n\nIf AI is as disruptive as many think it will be, there is no valuation model, no company, and perhaps no industry that is safe.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMeta giving up on the metaverse is not the real story here. The real story is that once again, Mark Zuckerberg has shown a willingness to change direction when needed. The market sees that willingness to change direction as a safety net. If AI succeeds, great, shareholders will reap the rewards. If it fails, Zuckerberg will cut his losses, rightsize the company, and continue to run the world's largest social media empire.\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my Substack for more valuations like this.\n\n",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORT**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-16 16:51:13 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: BEARISH WITH DEFENSIVE ROTATION**\nThe aggregate sentiment is **bearish**, driven by a confluence of negative catalysts and defensive positioning.\n*   **Reddit Retail Sentiment:** Reflects frustration (flat annual returns despite high activity) and focus on negative macro shocks (oil crash, iRobot bankruptcy). The presence of GameStop and \"Dr. Burry\" posts indicates a persistent, speculative undercurrent, but not a dominant bullish force.\n*   **Institutional & News Flow:** The S&P 500 decline on a \"mixed\" jobs report suggests the market is interpreting economic data through a hawkish or recessionary lens. Bond market wavering indicates uncertainty over the Fed's path.\n*   **Macro Data Context:** An elevated VIX (16.5) and a 10Y yield at 4.18% with a 4.6% unemployment rate point to lingering stagflation concerns, supporting a risk-off tone.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES**\n*   **Commodity Shock & Geopolitical Risk:** The collapse of WTI crude below $55 is a dominant theme (Reddit scores 0.92, 0.91, 0.87). This is juxtaposed with news of a potential Trump-ordered Venezuelan tanker blockade, creating extreme volatility and uncertainty in energy markets.\n*   **Media Sector M&A Turmoil:** Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is central, with Reddit and Bloomberg highlighting the rejection of Paramount's bid and Kushner's Affinity withdrawing. This signals a fraught deal environment and funding concerns.\n*   **Economic Data Dislocation:** The November jobs report (BLS) is a key catalyst, but its \"mixed\" nature is causing confusion and risk aversion rather than providing clarity.\n*   **Credit & Default Risks Emerging:** News of Fitch downgrading Colombia, UOB's property loan struggles, and KIK's rescue loan point to rising stress in global credit markets, particularly in real estate and emerging economies.\n*   **Retail Trailer Fatigue & Speculative Hangover:** Reddit narratives highlight trader stagnation (\"ended the year at $155K\") and the collapse of former meme stocks (iRobot), indicating a draining of speculative excess.\n\n### **3. CRITICAL MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Primary Catalyst (Bearish):** The **oil price crash** is a major deflationary and growth scare signal for the global economy, overwhelming any short-term geopolitical supply risk.\n*   **Market Structure Signal:** The \"mixed\" jobs report leading to an equity sell-off and bond market \"wavering\" suggests the market is in a **\"bad news is bad news\" regime**, fearing economic weakness more than it hopes for Fed pivots.\n*   **Liquidity/Stress Signal:** The surge in micro-cap stocks (VMAR +156%, SRXH +23.78%) alongside major index weakness is a classic sign of **retail-driven, low-quality speculation** in a thin market, often a late-cycle or corrective phase behavior.\n*   **Sector-Specific Catalyst:** The **WBD-Paramount-Netflix** saga rejection is a signal of tightening financing conditions and strategic retrenchment in the capital-intensive media sector.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Demand Destruction:** The oil price plunge may be forecasting a sharper global slowdown than priced in.\n    2.  **Credit Event Spillover:** Deteriorating credit quality in China property and EM (Colombia) could trigger broader risk contagion.\n    3.  **Earnings Risk:** A strong dollar and slowing demand pose significant headwinds to S&P 500 earnings forecasts.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Defensive Rotation:** Capital is likely to rotate towards sectors insulated from economic cycles (utilities, consumer staples).\n    2.  **Volatility Harvesting:** Elevated and potentially rising VIX presents opportunities in options strategies.\n    3.  **Bottom-Fishing in Energy:** The extreme dislocation between price collapse and geopolitical risk may create a tactical bounce opportunity in select energy names, though the trend is strongly bearish.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**WATCH:**\n*   **/CL (WTI Crude) Futures:** Monitor for stabilization above $55 or a break below $54. The reaction to Venezuelan news will test whether the market is purely demand-driven.\n*   **VIX Term Structure:** Watch for inversion (front-month > back-month), which would signal rising near-term equity fear.\n*   **10Y-2Y Treasury Spread:** For any steepening, which could signal recession fears are peaking.\n\n**ACT:**\n*   **SECTOR: ENERGY (XLE) - AVOID/Cautious Short.** The trend is powerfully down. Any long exposure should be considered a highly speculative, tactical bounce trade. Prefer shorting rallies.\n*   **SECTOR: DEFENSIVES (XLU, XLP) - OVERWEIGHT.** Utilities and Consumer Staples are likely relative outperformers in this sentiment and macro backdrop.\n*   **SECTOR: MEDIA & ENTERTAINMENT - UNDERWEIGHT.** The failed M&A and funding concerns (WBD, PARA) highlight sector-wide pressures. Favor streaming leaders (NFLX) over traditional conglomerates.\n*   **SYMBOL: VIX / VIXY - HEDGE.** Consider long volatility positions or equity portfolio hedges. A VIX at 16.5 with a bearish catalyst set has asymmetric upside risk.\n*   **SYMBOL: UUP (USD Bull ETF) - WATCH FOR STRENGTH.** Global risk-off and EM stress typically benefit the US Dollar, which would further pressure multinational earnings.\n\n---\n**CONCLUSION:** The market is in a defensive, risk-off posture driven by a growth scare (oil), credit concerns, and confusing economic data. Retail sentiment is frustrated but not yet capitulatory. **Prioritize capital preservation.** Reduce exposure to cyclical sectors (energy, industrials, discretionary) and low-quality speculations. Increase allocations to defensives, cash, and hedges. The next major pivot point will be the market's interpretation of subsequent inflation (CPI) and retail sales data.",

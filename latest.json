Trust me…I know. I’m in an absolute low right now and I pray that one day I can pullback. I managed to get a temporary extension for what is owed but I lost everything because I got lucky with liberation day, I made a lot because it and had plans to start my life with my girlfriend, she doesn’t know yet but each day I don’t tell her is killing me.\nI sold the house I grew up in, a burden I never wanted to deal with and I explicitly said I don’t want to worry about what is owed, I was naive enough to do my taxes on my own which came around liberation day and I genuinely did not expect to end the year like this.\nI made plans on paying my taxes several times and let it slip by and here I am.\nI wish a golden trade came my way and gave me a valuable life lesson and scare but I made my grave and I hope my girlfriend will forgive me.\nI have adhd and struggle with it daily, I chased the dopamine and panicked, fumbled hard.\nIf anything I wish to say please don’t do what I did, do not chase the dream because you’ll be left with a nightmare.\nIt’s so bad…",

      "content": "Oracle +5% after hours after TikTok signs binding US joint venture with Oracle taking 15% stake\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-says-signed-agreements-create-222642566.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-says-signed-agreements-create-222642566.html)\n\n&gt;TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew told employees that the social media company and its parent, ByteDance Ltd., signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture majority-owned by American investors\n\n&gt;In an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Chew said he was “pleased to share some great news” and said agreements with Oracle Corp., Silver Lake and MGX have been signed. Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22, 2026.\n\n&gt;“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” Chew said in the memo. Meanwhile, “TikTok global’s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing,” he wrote.\n\n&gt;The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September, which was pending approval from China. Chew’s memo does not mention China’s opinion on the transaction. It says 50% of the investors will be new, with Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment company, retaining 15% each; 30.1% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance.\n\n&gt;After more than a year of negotiations, Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance’s popular video app to a consortium of investors. If finalized, the deal would remove a persistent issue in Beijing-Washington relations and signal progress in broader talks. But it would also deprive China’s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon.\n\n&gt;ByteDance’s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok’s business. Under the the deal proposed by Washington, ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity, which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle, TikTok’s cloud partner.\n\n&gt;Trump’s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know?: QuickTake\n\n&gt;The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement, which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration. US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app’s recommendation algorithm.\n\n&gt;Under the law, the initial deadline for the sell-or-ban rule was this past January, but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office, most recently pushing it into January 2026.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bes8jzkrv18g1.png?width=1587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f406b925304f2c0ce50176783172b3016adb28fc\n\n",

      "content": "Vitalik Buterin Warns Elon Musk That X's Hate Campaigns Could Hurt Free Speech\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed issues to Elon Musk, arguing that the recent surge of \"unhinged\" hate speech and coordinated attacks against Europe on X (formerly Twitter) is jeopardizing the very future of free speech. Following a €120 million fine imposed on X by the European Commission for Digital Services Act violations—including issues with the paid verification system and lack of transparency—Buterin observed that discourse on the platform has shifted from policy debate to \"emotionally-manipulative misinformation.\"\n\nButerin expressed concern that Musk has turned the platform into a \"death star laser for coordinated hate sessions,\" specifically targeting European cities like London and delegitizing the EU. He argues that this behavior risks a massive global backlash against liberal values in the coming years. While acknowledging valid criticisms of EU bureaucracy and surveillance, Buterin maintains that X’s current trajectory—where algorithms are \"arbitrarily\" tweaked to boost rage over civility—is a structural risk to democratic values.\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin proposed two primary solutions:\n\n* Algorithmic Transparency: Disclosing optimization targets so users understand what the platform is promoting and why.\n* On-Chain Verification: Using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and time-stamping decisions on-chain to make the algorithm more transparent and less susceptible to manual manipulation or censorship.\n\nUltimately, Buterin views the survival of a unified, reformed Europe as a vital global model and fears that Musk’s \"personal vendetta\" against EU regulators is weaponizing the platform in a way that will eventually lead to the destruction of the free speech principles Musk claims to defend.",

      "title": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector",
      "content": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector\n\nA few weeks ago I saw an interesting post here about the [energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pbgprq/energy_stocks_are_still_cheap_and_nobody_seems_to/) sector. The basic idea was straightforward:\n\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data center capacity planned over the next five years, and data centers are extreme power consumers. In the U.S., a large share of power generation still comes from hydrocarbons, especially natural gas. Companies that provide that energy appear to be overlooked.\n\nWhat that post didn’t get into was a deeper dive into the energy companies themselves — specifically, which ones might actually offer attractive opportunities today.\n\nSo I decided to do that. I used a tool I built that ingests SEC filings for each company and supplements them with industry data from:\n\n* American Petroleum Institute\n* U.S. Energy Information Administration\n* American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers\n* Society of Petroleum Engineers\n* Journal of Petroleum Technology\n* World Oil\n* Oil and Gas Journal\n* Hydrocarbon Processing\n\nI produced 10+ reports across different energy companies. After going through all of them, the companies that stood out to me were:\n\n* [Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/BjArBLK0WHRj) – this was the most interesting to me given that it generated \\~$8.1B of TTM free cash flow in 2024 on a \\~$73B market cap (a mid-teens FCF yield if sustained), while the stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months (+0.9%). It trades at \\~7x EV/EBITDA and \\~12x TTM EPS, despite controlling \\~20.1B boe of long-life 2P oil sands reserves and producing \\~1.36M boe/d. The valuation appears to reflect market skepticism around long-duration durability and Canadian policy risk more than near-term cash generation.\n* [Matador Resources (MTDR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/eXS9JPBjEbOK) – MTDR stood out because balance-sheet stress is not evident in the current numbers: net debt sits below \\~1x EBITDA, production continues to grow in the Delaware Basin, and the company owns majority-interest, largely fee-based midstream assets (San Mateo / Pronto) that support cash-flow stability. Despite this, the stock trades around \\~3x EV/EBITDA, a multiple more commonly associated with higher leverage or structurally challenged E&amp;Ps.\n* [Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/YDjQ0bF0lQjM) – In contrast to the commodity-exposed producers, EPD’s appeal is the consistency of its cash generation: operating cash flow has stayed above \\~$7.5B annually since 2021, distribution coverage has run \\~1.6–1.7x, and the partnership retained \\~$3.24B in 2024 after distributions. Units trade around \\~7.5x EV/EBITDA despite this level of cash-flow stability and balance-sheet strength.\n\nI’m also sharing the reports for the other companies I analyzed in case anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [CHEVRON CORP (CVX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/dPtgVsyaOVZt)\n* [ANTERO RESOURCES Corp (AR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/IDhlgnNAdAUB)\n* [AEMETIS, INC (AMTX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/qWCT1bsvIyDj)\n* [NextDecade Corp (NEXT)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/JJZlaAD3JrFK)\n* [AMEREN CORP (AEE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/bz6cvzIIw5KP)\n* [SM Energy Co (SM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/2rQK36fGNwaD)\n* [Crescent Energy Co (CRGY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/DDSGWbDUlote)\n* [EXXON MOBIL CORP (XOM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/p9Lzg0rb1qKZ)\n* [OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP (OXY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/8ZSEPD2k7oDk)\n* [Vital Energy, Inc. (VTLE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/sYfs8N4YJHVR)\n* [WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. (WMB)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/z2j2kNtxUEXR)\n\nCusious to hear which energy stocks others here are following. Any interesting ones I missed?",

This block carried a base reward of about 3.125 BTC (following the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced mining subsidies), plus additional transaction fees that pushed the total payout slightly higher. The block's hash is 0000000000000000000039a7a8d1b6b3b4f1e8e4f868c4, and it processed over 2,800 transactions, highlighting the ongoing activity on the Bitcoin network despite its immense scale.\n\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/928351\n\nI wouldn’t recommend you trying this though, as you probably will have better odds buying lottery tickets.

Buffett will be particularly missed at a time when many of the most successful people in the business community seem single-mindedly focused on making money, without reflecting much on the way they make it or what they will do with it. Just because you *can* doesn’t mean you *should*.\n\nMakes me a little sad that I got interested in this topic this year, at the tail of end Buffett's career. \n\n",

      "content": "Will memory chip prices continue to skyrocket?\n\nMicron's earnings report showed strong demand for memory chips, easing investor concerns about a potential slowdown in data center construction. Micron Technology's adjusted revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $13.64 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations of $12.95 billion; adjusted net profit was $5.482 billion, compared to $3.469 billion in the same period last year. The company projected second-quarter revenue of $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion, significantly higher than the market expectation of $14.3 billion. Morgan Stanley analysts stated that, besides Nvidia, this might be the largest upward revision of revenue and net profit guidance in the history of the US semiconductor industry.\n\nKey data at a glance: Not only did the first-quarter performance exceed expectations, but the second-quarter revenue guidance was even higher, at $18.7 billion ± $400 million, a full $4 billion more than the market estimate of $14.38 billion! This data is not isolated, but rather a \"charge signal\" for the full recovery of the memory chip industry.",

That seems fairly straightforward to analyze - what is the total payment volume, how is it growing, and what is the take rate. Okay. \n \nBut the other part of the financial arms is extending consumer credit. They extend loans to consumers, to buy things on the platform, and have to hold some provisions for losses for these. \n \nThis is more like a banking operation. But unlike a bank, you can’t really disentangle the lending operations from the e-commerce part of the business - since the credit is fuelling purchases on the platform. And you can’t really pull out the balance sheets of these operations to analyze for financial soundness. Finally, we don’t really have great historical analogues for consumer credit cycles in these emerging markets like Latin America and Southeast Asia. \n \nFor investors in these companies, how do you analyze the lending divisions of these companies?

      "content": "Insane valuation of Tesla\n\n Tesla Stock is \"Ridiculously Overvalued\". Years of shareholder dilution is the central concern. Also Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and  the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders.\n\n Tesla’s SEC filings show that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market.\n\n Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution.\n\n Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards.\n\nTesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels.  Absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.\n\nThis is my follow up post to my previous post on the same space which got deleted bcoz I didn't do any detailed analysis.Here you have it",

There are by my calculations exactly 0 new power plants being built, for the most part the power companies are focusing on making them more efficient or expanding some but shovels breaking ground on new is zero and its been zero since Biden passed the build back act.  \n\nIn my opinion there is a pretty clear reasons why none have gotten off the ground, they have long build times and there are countless ways that they can be derailed.  \n\nThe reason for Texas is that they have a unique power grid that allows for open market bidding on power and its not meaningfully connected to the eastern or western part of the US grid.    \n\nIf my thesis is correct that data centers will require a huge amount of power, can be put up very quickly, have vast resources to bid on the open market and no new power sources are coming online for at least 10 years, the premium that the producers of power in Texas will be able to charge is going to go up significantly.

      "content": "Not overreacting to the NVDA insider sale\n\nNvidia director Harvey Jones sold about 250,000 shares around $177 for roughly $44M. These were shares he’s held for decades, and he still controls over 7M shares through a trust, so I read this as long term trimming more than a confidence signal turning negative. (News source if you’re interested: Nvidia Executives Sell Over $41 Million in Stock)For me, the headline only matters if it lines up with the chart. NVDA is in a pretty defined zone and the $177 to $180 area is the near term pivot. That’s roughly where the sale happened, and it has also been a tough area for the stock to push through lately. If NVDA can reclaim $180 and stay above it for a few closes, it’s basically the market saying it does not care about the insider headline.On the downside, I’m watching $169 to $171 as first support. If that breaks cleanly, the next likely stop is the mid $160s, around $165 to $160. Below that, you’re probably looking at the low $150s, and that usually needs a broader market wobble or a real shift in the AI narrative. This is also why I’m not overreacting to the insider sale by itself. Big, long held positions get trimmed all the time. Without a real break in price or a clear change in demand signals, it’s not enough for me to call a top.",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-18 23:02:19 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral-to-Bullish with Elevated Retail Skepticism**\n- **Macro Data Supports Cautious Optimism:** The reported December CPI of 2.7% (from Reddit) aligns with a continued disinflationary trend, supporting the narrative for potential Fed rate cuts. This is corroborated by the RSS news headline \"Asia Stocks Rise as US CPI Backs Fed Cut Bets.\" The 10Y Treasury Yield at 4.16% and a VIX of 17.62 suggest a relatively calm, risk-on environment.\n- **Retail Sentiment is Cynical and Distracted:** Reddit discussions reveal deep skepticism about official data (\"Pretty much 0 CPI data... but we are meant to believe it's 2.7%\") and a continued focus on meme stocks (GME, DJT) and loss porn. This creates a sentiment disconnect: the macro backdrop is improving, but the retail cohort remains distrustful and engaged in speculative, non-economic-driven assets.\n- **Conclusion:** Institutional and macro-driven sentiment is mildly bullish on rate cut hopes. Retail sentiment is neutral-to-bearish, dominated by speculation and data distrust, which can lead to volatile, sentiment-driven moves in specific names but does not reflect broad market direction.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES: **Inflation Narrative, Speculative Retail Mania, and Geopolitical Shifts**\n- **Inflation & Fed Policy Dominance:** The primary cross-source theme is the inflation trajectory and its implications for monetary policy. This is the core market driver.\n- **Retail Speculation & Meme Stock Resurgence:** A significant theme on Reddit is the re-emergence of meme stock narratives (GME, DJT). The Trump Media (DJT) merger with TAE Technologies is a major focus, representing a fusion of political and speculative trading.\n- **Global Macro Shifts:** RSS news highlights important regional developments: Japan's rising yields (also on Reddit), Europe's industrial struggles, India's economic reforms, and a potential TikTok US joint venture. This points to a fragmenting global economic landscape with divergent regional stories.\n- **Distrust in Institutions & Data:** A pervasive undercurrent on Reddit is skepticism towards official economic data, corporate leadership (e.g., Apple buybacks), and financial institutions.\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS AND CATALYSTS\n- **Primary Catalyst (Confirmed):** **US CPI at 2.7%.** This is the key data point driving global risk assets higher, as seen in the Asia market reaction. It solidifies the path for 2025 Fed easing.\n- **Secondary Catalyst (Speculative):** **Trump Media (DJT) Merger.** This $6B deal with a fusion energy company is a major sentiment driver for retail traders and could siphon speculative capital from broader markets.\n- **Warning Signal:** **Japan's 10Y Yield >2%.** This is a significant breakout with potential global implications for capital flows and currency markets, though it's not yet a dominant market focus.\n- **Technical Signal:** **NVDA's positive move (+1.87%)** amid low-volatility tickers suggests big-tech/AI leadership remains intact, supporting overall market stability.\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n- **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Sentiment-Driven Volatility:** Concentrated retail frenzy in names like DJT and GME can create localized bubbles and sudden, sharp reversals that impact retail brokerages and sentiment indices.\n    2.  **Data Credibility Gap:** Widespread public distrust of economic data (a Reddit theme) is a social risk that could undermine the perceived legitimacy of policy moves and lead to unpredictable market reactions.\n    3.  **Global Spillover:** Japan's rising yield could precipitate unexpected volatility in FX and global bond markets if it accelerates.\n- **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Policy Divergence Trades:** The clear Fed easing trajectory vs. other global central banks (e.g., BOJ potentially tightening) creates opportunities in FX and rate markets.\n    2.  **Meme Stock Volatility:** The predictable cycles of hype and despair in retail favorites present opportunities for sophisticated volatility and options strategies.\n    3.  **Sector Rotation:** The \"Autos are the new Banks\" theme from a top-performing Euro-area fund suggests a deep rotational opportunity into cyclical industrials, especially in Europe.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n- **SECTOR: European Autos/Industrials** - Monitor for sustained rotation. The RSS news highlight from a top fund is a strong signal for institutional flow. This aligns with a recovering Europe narrative (cheaper gas) and global cyclical recovery.\n- **SYMBOL: /6J (Japanese Yen Futures)** - The break of 2% on the JGB is a structural shift. Watch for continued weakness in the JPY as the Bank of Japan faces pressure to normalize policy, offering a clear macro trend opportunity.\n- **SYMBOL: DJT** - **Extreme Caution.** This is a pure sentiment play disconnected from fundamentals. The merger news will fuel massive volatility. Only suitable for very short-term, high-risk trading. Expect severe whipsaw.\n- **ASSET CLASS: Long-Dated US Treasuries (e.g., TLT)** - The CPI data confirms the disinflation trend. A Fed cutting cycle is the primary macro theme for 2025, making long-duration bonds a core strategic holding, though be wary of supply and fiscal risks.\n- **WATCH: VIX Term Structure** - The current VIX at ~17.6 is complacent given the geopolitical and event risks (e.g., TikTok deal, election policy). A steepening contango could signal rising near-term dealer hedging demand for protection.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is trading on a confirmed \"Goldilocks\" CPI narrative, but beneath the surface, retail activity is dominated by speculative mania and data distrust. **Focus on the macro trend (Fed easing) for core positioning, but allocate a small portion to trade the volatility from the retail-driven sentiment disconnects.** The most actionable institutional signal is the rotation into European cyclicals.",

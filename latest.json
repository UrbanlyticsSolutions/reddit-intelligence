This block carried a base reward of about 3.125 BTC (following the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced mining subsidies), plus additional transaction fees that pushed the total payout slightly higher. The block's hash is 0000000000000000000039a7a8d1b6b3b4f1e8e4f868c4, and it processed over 2,800 transactions, highlighting the ongoing activity on the Bitcoin network despite its immense scale.\n\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/928351\n\nI wouldn’t recommend you trying this though, as you probably will have better odds buying lottery tickets.

      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

Just sit it out like Buffett or just put some money in the S&amp;P 500 and that's it. Save it for \"good times\" which are the opposite for \"normal\" investors.\n\n**\"This stock went up 700%, is this stock good?\"**\n\nIf the only value you see is that the stock went up by 700%+, that's not value investing...\n\n**\"Should I buy Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, XYZ?\"**\n\nWhat about you do your own DD and stay in your area of competence. If you don't know why a stock went up, you won't understand why it goes down...\n\nYou should know when a company is undervalued and when it's overpriced.\n\n**\"I bought a stock one month ago, it went down 5%, should I sell?\"**\n\nIf you truly did your DD and you are a value investor, you just sit it out. You have time; you bought to hold it for years. I have stocks in my portfolio for over 10 years...\n\nI could go on and on and on, like trimming your portfolio every month, just looking at the numbers and not understanding the company, etc., etc., etc.!\n\n  \n**\"This stock dipped 30% everybody all in\"** \n\nI heard this story 100s times, I always ask, what makes you believe that it will go up again ? If you dont have a good answer dont buy! \n\n  \n\n\nIt's not that difficult to be a value investor. All you need is:\n\n**Benjamin Graham - The Intelligent Investor**\n\nMake sure you truly understand it, I needed time to understand it fully! If you are too lazy to read one book, you probably don't have the discipline to be a value investor.\n\nBonus: If this book is to \"difficult\" (no shame in that, I started very very slow) start with Peter Lynch + Youtube New Money.\n\nMost of you have the knowledge but some here either dont understand Valueinvesting or simply dont have the dispcpline and try to chase quick returns.\n\nEverything I do isnt based on my \"opinion\" or community posts its based on the tools of people who 100x smarter than me like Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham etc.\n\nWith these tools I try to find \"gaps\" in the marked and thats it. Sometimes it takes years sometimes only month. I have time!",

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions. These bonds would likely be best suited in a retirement account due to the federal, state, and local tax implications.",

      "content": "Musk wins appeal and restores 2018 Tesla pay deal worth $56 billion\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Delaware's Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package from Tesla, which was once valued at $56 billion. Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.”\n\nThe ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThis compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November.\n\nThe ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares.\n\nMusk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock.\n\nIn 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded.\n\nMusk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies.\n\nTesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands.\n\nIn November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales.\n\nTesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan.\n\nThe Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.",

      "content": "Clustered 10b5-1 plan adoptions at Wave Life Sciences, normal or notable?\n\nI’m looking for feedback from people who’ve looked at insider trading patterns before.\n\nWave Life Sciences (WVE) stock jumped \\~3x on December 8 following positive interim trial results. On that same day, 8 executives/directors executed stock sales under 10b5-1 plans. I understand the same-day execution is plausibly explained by price-based triggers or limit orders.\n\nHowever, I saw that the 8 plans that executed on December 8 were initiated in two clusters:\n\n* 3 plans on March 13, 2025\n* 5 plans on August 6, 2025\n\nI pulled Form 4 data for Wave from 2024–2025 to look closer at this pattern and wrote up the details here [https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/](https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/)\n\nMy question:  \nI'm relatively new to this. Is this kind of clustered 10b5-1 adoption and execution fairly typical in biotech or other industries? Is this easily explained by compensation cycles/normal planning, or is this something you’d flag as worth a second look? \n\nI haven't yet benchmarked against a larger sample of biotech companies, that's on my list if this is indeed notable.",

      "content": "Is enhanced direct indexing the right choice for me?\n\nBackground: over a decade ago I invested a sizeable chunk of my savings into a big tech company that has done well over the intervening years. Now I find myself in a position where a large percentage of my portfolio is in this single security and I'm looking to diversify.\n\nI have been told that enhanced direct indexing is a good option for unwinding a concentrated position. I'm a novice here but if I understand it correctly, for a non-trivial fee, a management firm will use my concentrated position as leverage to buy long and short positions and use tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains, effectively diversifying while deferring the large taxable event.\n\nAre there big inherent risks I'm not aware of? Are there other options I should consider? I recognize there's a real risk by having nearly half of my portfolio in a single security but I don't want to make a mistake and take an even greater risk trying to unwind it. \n\nThanks!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 14:01:55  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral to Cautiously Bullish**  \n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Mixed but leaning skeptical. Retail traders show heightened sensitivity to volatility catalysts (e.g., \"record witching day,\" GameStop chatter) and macro fears (debt, inflation data quirks). However, memes like \"Google has GME at $406\" suggest speculative froth persists.  \n- **News Flow:** Bloomberg headlines (\"Santa Rally Still in Play\") indicate institutional optimism, but noise warnings (\"Data Is Very Noisy\") and event risks (options expiry, BoJ hike) temper enthusiasm.  \n- **Macro Data:** VIX at 16.87 suggests moderate complacency; 10Y yield at 4.12% and Fed funds at 3.64% reflect a still-restrictive backdrop. Equity risk premium of 4.33% offers some buffer.  \n- **Conclusion:** Sentiment is bifurcated—institutional \"Santa Rally\" narrative vs. retail skepticism—creating a fragile equilibrium.\n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES  \n**A. Macro Policy Shifts & Debt Concerns**  \n- BoJ’s rate hike (highest in 30 years) and Japan’s 10Y yield >2% signal a historic pivot, potentially draining global liquidity.  \n- U.S. debt sustainability fears ($38T debt, $1T+ annual interest) and contested inflation data (\"zero housing inflation\" assumptions) erode confidence in fiscal/monetary stability.  \n\n**B. Event-Driven Volatility**  \n- Record \"witching day\" (quadruple expiry) on Friday may amplify short-term gyrations.  \n- Political catalysts: Trump’s drugmaker deals, FTC antitrust probes (Collectors Holdings).  \n\n**C. Speculative Retail Behavior**  \n- Meme-stock resurgence (GME, mining gains story) and trading card grading monopoly allegations point to niche, sentiment-driven manias.  \n- Retail distrust of media (\"Extreme media fud warning\") and institutional narratives.  \n\n**D. Sector-Specific Stress**  \n- Transport/industrial strain (Colorado steel mill halting rail shipments).  \n- Emerging market distress (Petroperu bonds at two-year lows).  \n- Tech earnings sensitivity (Nike \"nuking after hrs\").  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Catalysts (Next 1-2 Days):**  \n- **Friday Options Expiry:** Unusually large \"witching\" volume could trigger gamma squeezes or unwinds, especially in high-beta names.  \n- **BoJ Aftermath:** Yen volatility and global bond re-pricing as Japan’s yield curve adjusts.  \n- **U.S. Data Skepticism:** Market may question November inflation methodology, affecting Fed policy expectations.  \n\n**Technical Signals:**  \n- **NVDA (+3.93%)** leading tech resilience, but **SOXS (-7.8%)** decline suggests short-covering in semis.  \n- **Gold (GLD $399)** stagnant despite debt fears—no safe-haven rush yet.  \n- **VIX 16.87:** Below 20 indicates complacency; watch for spike on witching volatility.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Liquidity Drain:** BoJ tightening could accelerate capital flight from risk assets.  \n2. **Debt Anxiety:** Rising interest costs may spark bond vigilante behavior, pressuring equities.  \n3. **Retail Fragility:** Meme-stock mania (e.g., GME, LAZR +174%) indicates pockets of irrationality vulnerable to sudden reversals.  \n4. **Geopolitical/Policy Uncertainty:** Antitrust actions (FTC), trade disruptions (rail halts), and political announcements (Trump) add unpredictability.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Santa Rally Momentum:** Seasonal tailwinds could lift large-caps (NVDA, tech) if macro fears ease.  \n2. **Volatility Plays:** Elevated VIX or post-witching dislocations offer mean-reversion setups.  \n3. **Yield Curve Steepeners:** BoJ shift may steepen global curves, benefiting financials.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**SYMBOLS & SECTORS TO WATCH:**  \n\n- **SPX/QQQ:** Monitor 12/19 options expiry pinning; any close above weekly highs confirms Santa Rally momentum.  \n- **NVDA:** Strength suggests AI/tech leadership intact, but overbought near $181; wait for pullback to add.  \n- **GME/AMC:** Extreme retail speculation (Google price glitch chatter) signals froth; avoid or use strict stop-losses.  \n- **TLT/JGBs:** BoJ hike may trigger bond volatility; consider short-duration hedges in equity portfolios.  \n- **Financials (XLF):** Beneficiary of higher global yields, but watch for debt-default spillover (Petroperu stress).  \n- **Transport (IYT):** Rail shipment halts imply supply-chain friction; avoid rail stocks short-term.  \n- **Volatility (VIX):** Hedge equity exposure ahead of Friday witching; VIX calls for tail-risk protection.  \n- **Gold (GLD):** Lack of reaction to debt fears is concerning; break above $405 needed to confirm safe-haven bid.  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** The market balances seasonal optimism against macro headwinds (BoJ, debt, data quirks). Prioritize capital preservation—reduce leverage into Friday’s expiry, favor quality large-caps over speculative retail darlings, and watch bond markets for liquidity signals. The Santa Rally is intact but fragile.",

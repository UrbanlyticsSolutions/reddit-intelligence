      "content": "NBIS is a steal at this price, change my mind\n\nI’m currently averaged at $96 on Nebius and I definitely wish I’d waited a bit longer to build my position. At these levels though, I genuinely think the stock is massively undervalued. A lot of the recent decline feels driven by bad sentiment driven by bad sentiment and a broader sell off after Oracle’s earnings. At current pricing, this looks like one of the biggest steals in the market to me.\n\nHere's why:   \n\n\n**- AI compute is structurally undersupplied.** \n\nThis is not a short cycle issue. Training and inference demand keeps growing faster than GPU supply, power availability and data center capacity. Companies that can actually deliver large scale GPU clusters with power and networking are the bottleneck.\n\nNebius sits right in that bottleneck.\n\n  \n**- Hyperscaler validation matters more than narratives**  \nMicrosoft signed up to $19.4B in multi year GPU capacity. Meta followed with another $3B. These are not pilot projects or optional experiments. This is mission critical infrastructure.\n\nIf Microsoft and Meta are willing to rely on Nebius for AI compute, the tech works and the execution bar has already been cleared at a very high level.\n\n  \n\\- **Extreme growth**   \nQ3 revenue was up 355% YoY.  \nARR today is roughly $550M and guided to ramp to $7–9B by the end of 2026 as contracted capacity comes online.  \nAI operations are already EBITDA positive with margins around 20%.\n\n**- Capex is not the problem people think it is**  \nYes, capex is massive. That is the business. But Nebius is sitting on roughly $5B in cash and raised convertibles at extremely low interest rates. Capital markets are clearly comfortable financing this growth because the demand is locked in by secured deals.\n\n  \n**- This is the most important one, everyone keeps forgetting the extra assets they own besides the cloud business**   \nMost people talk about Nebius as if it’s just an AI cloud provider. That’s missing a big part of the picture.\n\nOn top of the cloud business, Nebius still owns several assets that have real value and are basically being priced at a huge discount or in my opinion even close to zero (!!) by the market right now.\n\nAvride ($2-3B valuation) is now partnered with Uber. Avride is working with Uber on delivery robots, which is a massive market on its own.\n\nThen there’s TripleTen ($300-500M)growing fast in a high margin digital space\n\nOn top of that, Nebius still has stakes in things like AI data annotation and database tech through Toloka and ClickHouse ($2B) . These aren’t random side projects, they sit right in the AI value chain and have raised at serious private valuations in the past.\n\nIf you do even conservative sum of the parts math, you’re talking about several billion in value outside of the core cloud business. Right now, the market seems to be valuing Nebius almost purely as “AI cloud plus execution risk” and ignoring everything else. \n\nIf Nebius actually hits the target of  $7–9B ARR in 2026, you’re looking at a forward revenue multiple of roughly 2.4x for the core cloud business. While others easily have a multiple of 5-10. \n\n**- The real risks**  \nI don't want to turn a blind eye to the risk, because ofc there are:   \n\\- Data center build timelines slipping  \n\\- Customer concentration  \n\\- Share dilution over time\n\nAll real. But they are execution risks, not demand risks. Chance of execution is (in my opinion) the highest at Nebius compared to others, because of their former Yandex experience.   \n  \nThis all seems to good to be true to me, so please convince me if i'm missing something here. Even a base case should provide a valuation of roughly 120-150$ according to my research. \n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's hostile bid\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery urged shareholders on Wednesday to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, stating the offer posed “significant risks and costs” to the company while Netflix's earlier proposal held greater value.\n\nMultiple companies have previously competed for Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns numerous classic films including Casablanca and the Harry Potter series. On December 5, Netflix agreed to acquire a portion of Warner Bros. Discovery for $82.7 billion; Paramount Skydance Media Group followed suit on December 8, offering to acquire the entire media group for $30 per share in an all-cash deal.\n\nNetflix has agreed to acquire Warner Bros.' HBO and its streaming and studio businesses, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 per share.\n\nParamount Sky Dance CEO David Ellison called it “a superior all-cash offer” when proposing to acquire all shares of Warner Bros. Discovery. Ellison stated that merging Warner Bros. Discovery's assets with those of Paramount Sky Dance (parent company of CBS News) would facilitate regulatory approval.\n\nA Paramount Pictures spokesperson has not yet responded to requests for comment.\n\nWhy Warner Bros. Discovery Favors Netflix\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery advised shareholders to reject Paramount Pictures' offer, stating its board believes the regulatory risks of both acquisition proposals are comparable. The company also indicated its analysis found Netflix's proposal which includes cash and Netflix stock to be more advantageous.\n\nThis has also raised concerns about the $40.65 billion equity investment in Paramount Sky Dance Media. Warner Bros. Discovery responded by stating, “The Ellison family has made no investment commitment of any kind.” According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person with a net worth of $243 billion.\n\nShortly before WarnerMedia made its proposal, Affinity Partners one of Paramount Sky Dance's financial backers announced its withdrawal from the hostile takeover bid. Affinity is a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAn Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that while the firm still believes Paramount Sky Dance's acquisition proposal holds “strong strategic merit,” it decided to withdraw due to “significant shifts in investment dynamics since our initial participation in October.”\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, the Warner Bros. Discovery board stated it views Netflix as having superior financial health, higher credit ratings, and greater market capitalization.\n\nThe letter stated: “Netflix's merger is fully backed by a publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion and an investment-grade balance sheet.”\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery added that Paramount Sky Dance's credit rating “is at or just one notch above ‘junk’ status with two major rating agencies,” while its market capitalization stands at $15 billion.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery also expressed concerns about Paramount's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its acquisition offer.\n\n“The trust's assets and liabilities would not be publicly disclosed and could change,” it wrote in its letter to shareholders. “As the name implies, revocable trusts typically contain provisions allowing assets to be transferred at any time.”\n\nAlthough Wednesday's shareholder letter indicated that Paramount's acquisition offer is not favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide whether to accept Paramount's bid for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery, and TNT.\n\n",

      "content": "NBIS; An Opportunity To Be A Generational Bag Holder\n\nHere is a company whose core business revolves around purchasing costly depreciating GPUs and renting their output out to hyper scalers such as Microsoft at a loss.\n\nTheir subsidiaries are arguably nothing but money-sinks (Clickhouse, AVride, etc.) and are outclassed by numerous competitors such as Snowflake, Starship Technologies, etc.\n\nWhile Revenue has grown 300%+ year over year, expenses have grown at a faster rate and the company is essentially burning through money.\n\n1. Secure a contract at a loss -&gt; \n\n2. Use contract to get a loan/funding -&gt; \n\n3. Build out infrastructure/acquire GPUs -&gt; \n\n4. Repeat -&gt; \n\n5. Hope to eventually become a competing AWS alternative for AI cloud solutions.\n\nThe problem: \n\nToday, the overwhelming majority of NBIS's revenue comes from hyper scalers looking to offload demand. NBIS is providing them the compute at a loss. \n\nAt anytime a hyperscaler(s) can choose to no longer use NBIS when unfavorable, which will completely cripple the company's finances.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are currently investing extremely heavily into their own data centers to keep up with demand, so the chance of Nebius acquiring customers that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, can't provide supply to in the future is low.\n\nThere is also huge uncertainty regarding NBIS's future cashflows, demand, and financial solvency. Shareholders may unknowingly be diluted to raise funds, a forced buy-out can happen, etc.\n\nOverall, NBIS is a great opportunity to become a generational bag holder. Simply ignore the financials and choose to invest off of vibes, chasing hype, etc., and you may potentially find yourself holding a bag for years to come.",

      "content": "With all the bubble talk, here's some optimistic data\n\nI'm not going to lie, I'm a little uneasy about this market. P/E ratio is high. Unemployment rate is rising. Stocks have been pretty weak in Q4. High beta stocks have gotten demolished. Buffet's cash pile is at an ATH. Aswath Damodaran is suggesting investors buy collectibles to diversify. The S&amp;P has returned over 20% two years in a row followed by \\~15% so far in '25. There's concerns over Oracle's debt, OpenAI making commitments they can't keep, circular deals, many people even believe we're in a full on bubble.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to point out some data that may make you rethink selling out of your stocks and going to cash.\n\n1. There have only been four years since 1938 where the S&amp;P 500 total return was -18% or worse. 1974, 2002, 2008, and 2022. So 4/87 years. Yes, 18% is somewhat cherry picked and of course cumulative peak to trough drawdowns have been much worse than 18%. But if you bought on the close of the last day of the trading year, you only lost 18% or more over the next 12 months 4.6% of the time.\n2. The S&amp;P 500 PEG ratio is currently 1.2 which is roughly about average since 1995. It was above 1.6 in 2016. Above 1.5 in 2004. And above 1.4 for much of the 2010s. It even got to 2.0 in 2023 but quickly reversed.\n3. The stock market has gone many years without a red total return year several times. Some notable stretches. 2009-2017. 1991-1999. 1982-1989. 1947-1952. So just because we've had three years of strong gains doesn't mean the bull market has to end here and come crashing down.\n4. The trailing P/E of the S&amp;P 500 is being obfuscated by a few highly weighted stocks with abnormal growth rates. Namely Nvidia, which has a 42x trailing P/E but a 22.5x forward P/E. Historically, the largest stocks in the market usually grew at 3-4% per year.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't good reasons to be bearish. I'm not saying that 2026 is going to be a great year. I'm not even saying that you shouldn't reduce risk or that going to cash won't be the right move in hindsight. I'm just trying to provide some balance to the current uneasy feeling many of us have. Earnings growth has been strong, AI could really improve GDP over the next 5-10 years, margins have been steadily increasing for a long time, and interest rates are coming down.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/](https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/)\n\n[https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns)",

      "content": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector\n\nA few weeks ago I saw an interesting post here about the [energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pbgprq/energy_stocks_are_still_cheap_and_nobody_seems_to/) sector. The basic idea was straightforward:\n\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data center capacity planned over the next five years, and data centers are extreme power consumers. In the U.S., a large share of power generation still comes from hydrocarbons, especially natural gas. Companies that provide that energy appear to be overlooked.\n\nWhat that post didn’t get into was a deeper dive into the energy companies themselves — specifically, which ones might actually offer attractive opportunities today.\n\nSo I decided to do that. I used a tool I built that ingests SEC filings for each company and supplements them with industry data from:\n\n* American Petroleum Institute\n* U.S. Energy Information Administration\n* American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers\n* Society of Petroleum Engineers\n* Journal of Petroleum Technology\n* World Oil\n* Oil and Gas Journal\n* Hydrocarbon Processing\n\nI produced 10+ reports across different energy companies. After going through all of them, the companies that stood out to me were:\n\n* [Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/BjArBLK0WHRj) – this was the most interesting to me given that it generated \\~$8.1B of TTM free cash flow in 2024 on a \\~$73B market cap (a mid-teens FCF yield if sustained), while the stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months (+0.9%). It trades at \\~7x EV/EBITDA and \\~12x TTM EPS, despite controlling \\~20.1B boe of long-life 2P oil sands reserves and producing \\~1.36M boe/d. The valuation appears to reflect market skepticism around long-duration durability and Canadian policy risk more than near-term cash generation.\n* [Matador Resources (MTDR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/eXS9JPBjEbOK) – MTDR stood out because balance-sheet stress is not evident in the current numbers: net debt sits below \\~1x EBITDA, production continues to grow in the Delaware Basin, and the company owns majority-interest, largely fee-based midstream assets (San Mateo / Pronto) that support cash-flow stability. Despite this, the stock trades around \\~3x EV/EBITDA, a multiple more commonly associated with higher leverage or structurally challenged E&amp;Ps.\n* [Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/YDjQ0bF0lQjM) – In contrast to the commodity-exposed producers, EPD’s appeal is the consistency of its cash generation: operating cash flow has stayed above \\~$7.5B annually since 2021, distribution coverage has run \\~1.6–1.7x, and the partnership retained \\~$3.24B in 2024 after distributions. Units trade around \\~7.5x EV/EBITDA despite this level of cash-flow stability and balance-sheet strength.\n\nI’m also sharing the reports for the other companies I analyzed in case anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [CHEVRON CORP (CVX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/dPtgVsyaOVZt)\n* [ANTERO RESOURCES Corp (AR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/IDhlgnNAdAUB)\n* [AEMETIS, INC (AMTX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/qWCT1bsvIyDj)\n* [NextDecade Corp (NEXT)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/JJZlaAD3JrFK)\n* [AMEREN CORP (AEE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/bz6cvzIIw5KP)\n* [SM Energy Co (SM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/2rQK36fGNwaD)\n* [Crescent Energy Co (CRGY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/DDSGWbDUlote)\n* [EXXON MOBIL CORP (XOM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/p9Lzg0rb1qKZ)\n* [OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP (OXY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/8ZSEPD2k7oDk)\n* [Vital Energy, Inc. (VTLE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/sYfs8N4YJHVR)\n* [WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. (WMB)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/z2j2kNtxUEXR)\n\nCusious to hear which energy stocks others here are following. Any interesting ones I missed?",

Historically, BOJ tightening has caused short-term dips before things stabilize  sometimes even setting up a decent bottom once the event risk clears. That said, with expectations this high, the bigger question might be how much of this move is already priced in. A hike could still cause turbulence, but a surprise hold would be even more disruptive given current positioning.\nCurious to see how others are positioning into this hedge, stay flat, or trade the post-decision reaction?",

Deadlines start slipping. A team that used to be fast suddenly moves slower.  \nBudgets stretch further than expected. Meetings multiply without producing decisions. Leaders start sensing friction but theyre not sure where it’s coming from. Is it workload imbalance?  A manager overwhelmed? A team operating without clarity? Resources being allocated the wrong way? Or something deeper, like burnout creeping through an entire department? The truth is inefficiency rarely announces itself. It builds quietly, hidden inside tools, systems, and processes that no one has time to examine. By the time the symptoms are loud enough for executives to notice, the problem has already become expensive. HR is expected to diagnose these issues yet theyre asked to do it without the one thing that would make it possible: connected, clear data. You cant fix what you cant see and most inefficiencies stay invisible far longer than they should and HR AI solutions are needed!!",

      "content": "Not overreacting to the NVDA insider sale\n\nNvidia director Harvey Jones sold about 250,000 shares around $177 for roughly $44M. These were shares he’s held for decades, and he still controls over 7M shares through a trust, so I read this as long term trimming more than a confidence signal turning negative. (News source if you’re interested: Nvidia Executives Sell Over $41 Million in Stock)For me, the headline only matters if it lines up with the chart. NVDA is in a pretty defined zone and the $177 to $180 area is the near term pivot. That’s roughly where the sale happened, and it has also been a tough area for the stock to push through lately. If NVDA can reclaim $180 and stay above it for a few closes, it’s basically the market saying it does not care about the insider headline.On the downside, I’m watching $169 to $171 as first support. If that breaks cleanly, the next likely stop is the mid $160s, around $165 to $160. Below that, you’re probably looking at the low $150s, and that usually needs a broader market wobble or a real shift in the AI narrative. This is also why I’m not overreacting to the insider sale by itself. Big, long held positions get trimmed all the time. Without a real break in price or a clear change in demand signals, it’s not enough for me to call a top.",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-18 07:02:08  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT  \n**Bullish with Caution**  \n\nThe market is exhibiting a **bullish tilt** driven by positive macro data (easing core CPI, upbeat tech outlook) and strong earnings beats (e.g., Micron). However, sentiment is **fragmented** and **retail-focused**, with Reddit discussions revealing skepticism (\"exit liquidity\" narratives, gamma squeeze debates) and pockets of volatility (notable single-stock sell-offs in Oracle, ASML). The VIX at 17.62 suggests moderate complacency, but retail chatter indicates underlying anxiety about sustainability and positioning.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES  \n**A. Inflation & Macro Relief:**  \n- Core CPI easing to slowest pace since 2021 (Bloomberg) is the dominant positive macro catalyst, supporting equity momentum.  \n- Unemployment at 4.6% remains stable, but Reddit posts highlight political narratives around job growth and household wealth (\"poverty, not wealth\").  \n\n**B. Tech Sector Divergence:**  \n- **Strength:** Micron's blowout earnings signal robust AI/hardware demand.  \n- **Weakness:** Oracle (-4% on data center financing snag), ASML (-6% on China EUV reports) show sensitivity to execution and geopolitical risks.  \n- Retail disillusionment with \"AI Infrastructure\" plays suggests sector rotation may be nearing a speculative peak.  \n\n**C. Political & Event-Driven Volatility:**  \n- Trump-related themes: DJT stock surge (+36.96%), \"warrior dividends\" announcement, and political economic narratives are influencing retail flows.  \n- Brazil FX hedges rising on election uncertainty reflect broader EM volatility.  \n\n**D. Crypto/FinTech Developments:**  \n- SoFi launching a stablecoin; TeraWulf $1.275B note offering indicate continued digital asset infrastructure expansion.  \n- Ex-Alameda CEO release (Caroline Ellison) is a minor sentiment marker for crypto markets.  \n\n**E. Retail Sentiment & Positioning:**  \n- \"Exit liquidity\" and \"gamma nightmare\" discussions reveal retail traders are wary of crowded momentum trades.  \n- Profit-taking behavior (\"paid cash for a Honda\") suggests a shift toward realized gains vs. speculative hold.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS  \n**Positive Signals:**  \n- **SPX supported** by cooling inflation and tech earnings strength.  \n- **Micron (MU)** blowout guidance confirms AI capex cycle vitality.  \n- **Stable rates environment:** 10Y yield at 4.15% with Fed funds at 3.64% suggests no imminent hawkish pivot.  \n\n**Warning Signals:**  \n- **Oracle (ORCL)** and **ASML (ASML)** dips on specific negative news show high sensitivity to headlines—caution in crowded tech trades.  \n- **VIX at 17.62** is not pricing in significant tail risks; complacency may be overdone.  \n- **Retail skepticism** (Reddit) contrasts with institutional bullishness (Bloomberg), indicating a potential sentiment divergence.  \n- **Extreme single-stock moves:** DJT (+36.96%), UGRO (+41.86%) reflect speculative froth in politically linked names.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Tech Concentration Risk:** Heavy reliance on few mega-cap tech names (ITOT’s 37% top-10 concentration) leaves market vulnerable to earnings disappointments or guidance cuts.  \n2. **Geopolitical/Trade Tensions:** ASML’s drop on China EUV reports highlights semiconductor supply chain sensitivities.  \n3. **Retail Overcrowding:** Gamma and exit liquidity discussions suggest momentum trades are extended; swift reversals possible.  \n4. **Political Volatility:** Trump/Biden policy uncertainty and election-year narratives may drive erratic sector rotations.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **AI/Data Center Infrastructure:** Despite Oracle’s stumble, long-term demand remains intact; look for companies with strong balance sheets and visible contracts.  \n2. **Defensive Yield:** Utilities (highlighted by Yahoo Finance) offer value after pullback, especially if rate cuts materialize in 2026.  \n3. **Stablecoin/FinTech Growth:** SoFi and crypto-adjacent plays may benefit from adoption tailwinds.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n\n**SECTORS:**  \n- **SEMICONDUCTORS (e.g., MU, NVDA, AMD):** Favor companies with proven execution and guidance visibility. Avoid names with debt-heavy capex plans (Oracle caution).  \n- **UTILITIES (XLU):** High-yielding utilities are contrarian buys for income and defensive positioning amid tech volatility.  \n- **FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY (SOFI, related crypto infrastructure):** Monitor stablecoin rollout adoption and regulatory developments.  \n\n**SYMBOLS:**  \n- **MU:** Strong buy on AI memory cycle; guidance suggests multi-quarter momentum.  \n- **ORCL:** Avoid near-term; monitor debt/data center financing news.  \n- **ASML:** Wait for clarity on China EUV competition; technical support near $600? (data not provided).  \n- **DJT:** Extreme volatility; purely speculative/political trade—high risk, avoid for fundamental investors.  \n- **SOXS:** Inverse semiconductor ETF spike indicates hedging activity; consider as short-term hedge if semiconductor momentum stalls.  \n\n**MACRO WATCH:**  \n- **Next CPI prints** for confirmation of disinflation trend.  \n- **Fed speakers** for any shift in tone post-CPI.  \n- **VIX spikes above 20** as signal to reduce risk exposure.  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**  \nThe market is bullish on cooling inflation and tech earnings, but retail sentiment reveals fragility and selective profit-taking. Focus on high-quality tech (Micron), defensive utilities for yield, and avoid headline-driven speculative names (Oracle, DJT). Monitor semiconductor momentum and VIX for signs of a broader pullback.  \n\n**Confidence Level:** 8/10 – Macro data clear, but retail/positioning risks are rising.",

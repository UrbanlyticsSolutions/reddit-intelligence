      "content": "Netflix agrees to buy Warner Bros. in a $72-billion deal that will transform Hollywood\n\nNetflix has prevailed in its bid to buy much of Warner Bros. Discovery, agreeing to pay $72 billion for the Burbank-based Warner Bros. film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.\n\nThe two companies announced the blockbuster deal early Friday morning. The deal would give Netflix such beloved characters as Batman, Harry Potter and Fred Flintstone.\n\n“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a statement. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like ‘Casablanca’ and ‘Citizen Kane’ to modern favorites like ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Friends’ — with our culture-defining titles like ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ and ‘Squid Game,’ we’ll be able to do that even better.”\n\nNetflix’s cash and stock transaction is valued at about $27.75 per Warner Bros. Discovery shares. Netflix also agreed to take on more than $10 billion in Warner Bros. debt, pushing the deal’s value to $82.7 billion.\n\nThe breakthrough came late Thursday, soon after a deadline for deal sweeteners. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast had submitted bids earlier in the week as jockeying intensified for Hollywood’s biggest prize.\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-12-05/netflix-prevails-in-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-opponents",

      "content": "Amazon is considering abandoning the USPS and establishing a competing postal service.\n\nAmazon is considering terminating its long-term contract with the United States Postal Service (USPS) to instead establish its own nationwide competitive delivery network.\n\nThe existing agreement between the e-commerce giant and the USPS expires in October 2026. The two parties have spent months negotiating the next version of the contract, but talks have become complicated due to President Trump's push to privatize the USPS.\n\nUnder the current deal, Amazon pays the USPS billions of dollars annually to distribute packages, accounting for roughly 7.5% of the agency's projected 2025 revenue. This agreement plays a crucial role in the USPS's financial model.\n\nHowever, Amazon already operates an extensive transportation network, including aircraft, Rivian electric vans, and an emerging drone delivery service though the drone project has faced multiple challenges this year, including a recent investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration. It is also developing autonomous vehicles through its subsidiary Zoox, further strengthening its control over last mile delivery.\n\nShould Amazon decide to terminate its partnership with the USPS, it could have significant implications for the logistics industry. As Amazon bolsters its logistics network, will companies like Rivian and Zoox see further growth opportunities?\n\n",

There is of course, also a chance of something else offering more growth with relatively similar level of safety. I also believe a lot of us are up on Google +50-150%.\n\nJust curious about people's opinions: at what time do you say, \"Okay, that is all for me folks, time to put this money elsewhere\"? (Be it another stock, an ETF, or cashing out?)\n\nEven if you don't see yourself exiting your position anytime soon, you probably do plan for the future. I'm curious to hear about your views on this.\n\n**Edit:** Wow, this post blew up. To anyone seemingly misunderstanding. I am NOT planning to exit my Google positions in the coming years let alone months. I was asking a theoretical question to learn. One thing I learned is that a huge part of this sub is saving almost primarily for retirement but that is different for me. I *am* investing for the long term (10y+) but not necessarily for retirement. I want to reap what I saw in this life still. \n\nI am also not from the US so me having food and shelter in my old age is NOT my individual responsibility, a huge chunk of my taxes already go towards a state-managed investment fund. My investments are totally independent from that platform and I don't intend to be a millionaire when I'm old, slow, and sick anyways :) I understand that in the US you have to manage your 401k on your own in some way and that your retirement fund is solely the individual's responsibility which is probably a very different reality to live in.\n\nAppreciate all the input folks, just please don't suggest I'm dumb, considering I was asking questions, not giving out advice.",

Sometimes all of it. Why? Because I've watched too many people ride winners back to zero waiting for \"just a bit more.\" The greed is real and it kills portfolios. That said - I break this rule for stuff I'm actually long on. Real estate that's throwing off cash? Not selling. Solana I'm staking? Staying put. Quality dividend plays? Those compound forever.\n\nBut random defi yields, momentum stocks, anything that smells like hype? 70% and gone. No second thoughts.

      "content": "‘China’s Nvidia’ Moore Threads surges over 400% on trading debut after $1.1 billion listing\n\nMoore Threads had a massive first day in Shanghai, jumping more than 400% after its $1.1 billion IPO. It’s one of the biggest debuts for a Chinese chip company this year and comes at a time when Beijing is pushing hard to build a domestic GPU ecosystem. The timing matters. With U.S. sanctions limiting China’s access to advanced manufacturing, companies like Moore Threads, Huawei, and Cambricon are all stepping in to fill the gap. China clearly wants local alternatives that can support AI, gaming, and data-center workloads without depending on U.S. suppliers. Moore Threads still has a long way to go in matching the performance of global leaders, but the market’s reaction shows how much enthusiasm there is behind China’s semiconductor push. The broader chip sector in China has been accelerating, with new entrants and established players all competing for the same growing demand. Curious what everyone thinks is this early hype or a sign that China’s GPU ecosystem is finally gaining real momentum?\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/china-nvidia-moore-threads-trading-debut-1-billion-listing-ipo-shanghai-gpu-enflame-biren.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/china-nvidia-moore-threads-trading-debut-1-billion-listing-ipo-shanghai-gpu-enflame-biren.html)",

The company, best known as Apple’s main iPhone assembler, also highlighted continued momentum in AI-related hardware.A big part of the growth seems to be coming from AI server racks the same systems powering data centers as companies scale up their infrastructure for model training and deployment. Foxconn has been leaning more heavily into that segment, and the numbers suggest it’s starting to show up meaningfully in results.For now, demand for AI hardware remains one of the steadier drivers in an otherwise mixed electronics market, and Foxconn looks like it’s benefiting directly from that shift.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/nvidia-partner-foxconn-reports-26percent-revenue-spike-as-ai-boom-continues.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "content": "Barron's Stock Picks : Weyerhaeuser Stock Trades for Less Than the Value of Its Lumber. It’s Time to Buy.\n\nBarron's latest stock pick: Weyerhaeuser lumber. Another interesting choice. \n\n  \n\"The 125-year-old company is the largest private owner of timberland in North America, with over 10 million acres, including valuable tracts in the Pacific Northwest, where it holds over two million acres. It also operates 33 manufacturing plants across the continent, where it produces wood products.\n\nLumber prices fell 20% this year, to $550 per 1,000 board feet. The shares, now around $21.50, have lost half their value since peaking in 2022, and trade where they did in the late 1990s.\"\n\n\"Shares of the Seattle-based company, which yield nearly 4%, now trade for less than the value of the timber assets Weyerhaeuser accumulated over a century, a fact that offers considerable downside protection to an already battered stock. And while Wall Street is downbeat on the housing market[d](https://www.barrons.com/articles/home-builder-stocks-0f5a401c?mod=article_inline) in 2026, that view could be too pessimistic. The stock offers massive upside if lumber and wood-products markets improve.\"\n\n  \nIt may not look that way at first glance. Weyerhaeuser, structured as a real estate investment trust, is now operating at just above break-even based on generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, earnings. The company is expected to earn 17 cents a share in 2025 and 26 cents in 2026. That puts its price/earnings ratio near 100.\n\nBut high valuations in economically cyclical stocks often signal a buying opportunity because they’re based on depressed earnings, which should recover. And Weyerhaeuser is capable of earning much more. It generated over $3 a share in earnings in 2021 and 2022, when lumber prices topped $1,000 per 1,000 board feet.\"\n\nThe stock looks far cheaper based on its net asset value. Weyerhaeuser is valued at about $2,000 per acre of its timberland based on its enterprise value of $21 billion, which combines a $16 billion equity market cap with $5 billion of net debt. That valuation is below the $2,800-an-acre price of the average timberland transaction in 2024 and 2025. The company’s forests in Oregon and Washington state are particularly valuable because they produce desirable wood from Douglas fir trees.\"\n\nTheir directors have also been buying recently. It's an interesting choice, and the recent Barrons picks have mostly increased or stayed flat, so if you have a long term view it could pay off. Until then the dividend is 4%.",

Personally, as far as an AI bubble is concerned, the market still has legs to run -- and empirical as this is, I don't think we'll have a crash when everyone has a crash at the back of their mind. Here's my current portfolio weights, how I'll be reallocating for the new year, and my predictions on how each will move! I'll be deleting my trading apps once the new year starts due to other commitments and come back to this post at the end of next year :)\n\n  \nNVDA - 17%  \nNvidia continues to be my largest holding. There is significant overlap with my ETFs, but it was and continues to be a long hold for me which I'm comfortable having overweight. Doubt we will see 30+% gains after such a huge run-up though, although a 20% gain wouldn't surprise me.\n\n  \nQQQ - 16%\n\nI've unfortunately been holding QQQ from a time I didn't realise there were alternatives (QQQM) with much lower expense ratios. Anyway, doesn't make sense for me to sell and buy back, but just a note for beginners. Mag 7 propelled it to 20+% gains this year, I'm predicting a more conservative but evenly distributed 12% gain in 2026, supported by more mid caps.\n\n  \nVOO - 15%\n\nEssentially the same thing as QQQ but with slightly less tech. Predicting a healthy 9% as tech continues to outpace other sectors.\n\n  \nAAPL - 11%\n\nThe Vision Pro hasn't seen much success yet, and I think it's very much a work in progress especially given the extremely high price point. However, with Apple regaining its spot as the top smartphone manufacturer and likely releasing a foldable phone next year, I think it'll continue to see revenue growth. Predicting a 16% upside.\n\n  \nMETA - 9%\n\nGreat to see that Metaverse expenditure is being cut, hope to see more of that in the coming year. While Meta AI is one of the worst AIs out there now, I don't think it'll be difficult for them to improve their model seeing how quickly Gemini has caught up with ChatGPT. As far as I'm concerned, the core advertising business continues to be a solid model and Instagram is still growing in terms of MAUs and average usage. Share price has been relatively shaky this year, but I think it will deliver more stable shareholder returns of 18%.\n\n  \nVT - 7%\n\nGoing to continue DCAing into VT, likely will be my top holding before the start of the new year. Non-US markets outperformed in the first half of 2025 but I don't have enough conviction to go into VXUS. Assuming global markets do better than the US, I'm projecting 11% upside.\n\n  \nXLU - 6%\n\nMy only defensive holding in utilities. Being capital-intensive, utilities should benefit greatly from a low-rate environment and having some exposure marginally reduces my drawdown risk. Looking to add on dips to increase holding as well. Don’t expect big gains, at most 8%, just on pace with the overall market. \n\n  \nDUOL - 5%\n\nOne of my only two high-risk plays. Down from highs over 540 this year, share price has begun to consolidate. The CEO mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that they are prioritising long-term user growth and teaching quality which was taken negatively by the market, but this is a good long-term outlook. With a 34% 3-5 year projected EPS growth rate, I expect the market to revalue the company more optimistically with a 32% gain.\n\n  \nANET - 3%\n\nLast but not least, my smallest holding (for now). My long-term AI data centre play that has a lot more upside than the big names have. Quite a volatile stock that has a high beta especially in tech downturns, but with the prospect of a continue, albeit slowing bull market, I believe renewed data centre investment will propel sales and earnings growth. My guess is 35%, and I will be adding ANET/VRT on dips close to their 50MA.\n\n  \nLet me know what you guys think about my predictions!",

I 24F am going to be graduating esthetician school in June and am going to be working as an esthetician for one year to save up money to launch a skincare business. I’ve done quite a bit of research into what it would be like to start a business and I’m quite motivated, but was wondering if anyone had any tips in terms of starting something from scratch. I was looking to save around $20-40k and take out a loan to have around $50-70k total. I think the thing that makes me the most anxious is the bookkeeping and what it would mean to grow my business enough that I’d eventually hire employees. It sounds like a lot of responsibility so I wanted to try to get a realistic expectation of how stressful it would be when starting. Any advice would be appreciated!",

The company, best known as Apple’s main iPhone assembler, also highlighted continued momentum in AI-related hardware. A big part of the growth seems to be coming from AI server racks  the same systems powering data centers as companies scale up their infrastructure for model training and deployment. Foxconn has been leaning more heavily into that segment, and the numbers suggest it’s starting to show up meaningfully in results.For now, demand for AI hardware remains one of the steadier drivers in an otherwise mixed electronics market, and Foxconn looks like it’s benefiting directly from that shift.",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-05 07:02:09 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral-to-Cautious**\n*   **Reddit Sentiment:** Dominated by negative, sensationalist headlines (crypto collapses, political blame, extortion claims). This reflects heightened retail anxiety, particularly around crypto and political narratives, but is not a reliable indicator of institutional direction.\n*   **News & Macro Data:** Mixed. Headlines show major M&A (potentially bullish for media), but also contain geopolitical tensions, corporate distress (China Vanke), and cautious central bank commentary (ECB). Market data shows modest pre-market moves with no extreme volatility (VIX at 15.78 is elevated but not panicked). The market appears to be in a holding pattern **ahead of key PCE inflation data**.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES\n*   **Mega-M&A in Media/Streaming:** The potential **Netflix-Warner Bros. Discovery** deal ($72-83B) is the dominant story, signaling industry consolidation and a scramble for content/IP scale.\n*   **Crypto & Digital Asset Turmoil:** A cluster of stories detail catastrophic losses in Trump-linked crypto projects and broader scams. This aligns with Bloomberg's note of Bitcoin decoupling from stocks, suggesting crypto is trading on its own (currently negative) narrative.\n*   **Geopolitical & Macro Policy Crosscurrents:** Stories on Russia/India, France/China, US/Congo minerals, and Ukraine targeting Russian infrastructure point to a fragmented global landscape affecting trade and commodity flows. Domestically, political narratives around affordability and regulation (fuel standards) are prominent.\n*   **Corporate Actions & Distress:** Microsoft's planned price hike (2026) contrasts with corporate stress (China Vanke's bond repayment delay, Kroger's quarterly loss, Trustpilot's scandal).\n*   **Retail Meme/Niche Focus:** Persistent chatter around **GME** (borrow fee spike, tax form reminders) indicates the niche but volatile retail meme-stock cohort remains active.\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (Today):** **US PCE Inflation Data**. This is the Fed's preferred gauge and will directly impact rate expectations. News indicates markets are rising *ahead* of this data, suggesting a cautiously optimistic positioning.\n*   **Major Catalyst:** **Netflix-WBD Deal Talks**. Confirmation could trigger sector-wide re-ratings (bullish for acquired company WBD, potentially bearish for other streamers facing a new behemoth). The discrepancy between Bloomberg ($72B) and Yahoo ($83B) on deal size warrants close watching.\n*   **Sector Signal:** **Crypto's Isolation.** The decoupling from equities, combined with horrific retail stories, signals a severe loss of speculative confidence in the crypto space that may not spill over into broad equities immediately.\n*   **Contrarian Sentiment Signal:** Overwhelmingly negative Reddit sentiment, especially if paired with a neutral/positive reaction to PCE data, could present a short-term bullish contrarian signal for broad indices.\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Inflation Surprise:** A hot PCE print could swiftly reverse pre-market optimism and reignite hawkish Fed fears.\n    2.  **Geopolitical Escalation:** Attacks on Russian energy infrastructure (Ukraine story) risk oil price volatility.\n    3.  **Credit Contagion:** Distress from Chinese property developers (Vanke) could renew fears about global financial stability.\n    4.  **Retail Liquidation:** A sharp downturn could be amplified if retail investors, already spooked by crypto losses, exit equity positions.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **M&A Arbitrage & Sector Plays:** The streaming deal creates potential pairs trades and sector rotation opportunities.\n    2.  **Data-Dependent Volatility:** A \"Goldilocks\" PCE print could fuel a relief rally, especially in rate-sensitive sectors.\n    3.  **Critical Minerals:** The US commitment to Congo's supply chain highlights a long-term strategic theme in materials/energy.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n*   **WBD:** Monitor for extreme volatility. A confirmed deal at a premium is likely priced in ($25.18, +2.63% pre-market). The greater opportunity may be in **NFLX** on deal clarity (cost of capital, strategic merit) or competitors like **DIS**, **PARA**.\n*   **SECTOR: Media & Streaming:** Expect heightened volatility and speculative positioning. Scrutinize companies with attractive content libraries that could become the next acquisition target.\n*   **SECTOR: Critical Minerals/Energy:** US funding for Congo's supply chain is a multi-year tailwind for companies in the battery metals ecosystem (e.g., **MP**, **ALB**, **LAC**). Geopolitical risks are high, but strategic importance is growing.\n*   **MACRO: Watch Treasury Yields & USD:** Reaction to PCE data will be clearest in the **10Y Yield (4.06%)** and the DXY. A rally would pressure yields, benefiting growth/tech. A sell-off would do the opposite.\n*   **GME:** The soaring borrow fee (3% to 31.41%) indicates extremely limited short-term share availability. This is a **technical powder keg** for a potential short squeeze, unrelated to fundamentals. High-risk, high-reward speculative play only.\n*   **CRYPTO (General):** **Extreme caution advised.** The confluence of scandal, collapse, and decoupling suggests this is a toxic environment for retail. Avoid catching falling knives.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is on pause for the PCE print. Headline M&A and crypto chaos are noise against this fundamental signal. Position for volatility, with the streaming deal offering the clearest post-data sectoral play. Maintain a neutral core bias until the inflation picture clarifies.",

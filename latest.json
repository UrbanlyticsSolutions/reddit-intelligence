      "content": "Saylor Says Lost Bitcoin May Need Freezing As Quantum Risk Rises\n\n\nI was surprised to see the debate this raised.  Gaining consensus is priority number one. That is hard because OGs don't like the term \"freeze.\" The proposal isn't writing rules to freeze particular keys, it is preventing use of signatures that are unsecure. So all holders would be given time to transition to private keys that are secure against post quantum capabilities.  I think Lopp frames the right questions and counterpoints. \n\nI've raised my thoughts on this as well and posted some ideas on how to transition.  I actually agree it doesn't make sense to leave open a method where quantum computing can steal keys.\n\nClosing that gap may come at the expense of some that fail to ever transition, but if they've been given years to transition, there isn't a strong argument that it isn't fair.  Securing the chain needs to happen.\n\nI've followed the quantum resistant coin category for a long time as a holder of Qanplatform.\n\nWhile many of the projects in the space talk about how they hope to capitalize from users seeking assets already prepared, I still view that as a long shot play.  Which is why most have moved toward building utilty chains. \n\nI think there is a large market incoming as all systems will be making upgrades.  Combining cryptography transition methods and blockchain utility will offer solutions enterprises want.  And they don't have the same decentralized challenges to overcome.  They can start implementing now, and we are seeing that happen.\n\nGlad to see the shift where nearly all coins are working on their approach.  It will be messy- some will falter and some will emerge.  It's worth paying attention to.  \n",

      "content": "NBIS is a steal at this price, change my mind\n\nI’m currently averaged at $96 on Nebius and I definitely wish I’d waited a bit longer to build my position. At these levels though, I genuinely think the stock is massively undervalued. A lot of the recent decline feels driven by bad sentiment driven by bad sentiment and a broader sell off after Oracle’s earnings. At current pricing, this looks like one of the biggest steals in the market to me.\n\nHere's why:   \n\n\n**- AI compute is structurally undersupplied.** \n\nThis is not a short cycle issue. Training and inference demand keeps growing faster than GPU supply, power availability and data center capacity. Companies that can actually deliver large scale GPU clusters with power and networking are the bottleneck.\n\nNebius sits right in that bottleneck.\n\n  \n**- Hyperscaler validation matters more than narratives**  \nMicrosoft signed up to $19.4B in multi year GPU capacity. Meta followed with another $3B. These are not pilot projects or optional experiments. This is mission critical infrastructure.\n\nIf Microsoft and Meta are willing to rely on Nebius for AI compute, the tech works and the execution bar has already been cleared at a very high level.\n\n  \n\\- **Extreme growth**   \nQ3 revenue was up 355% YoY.  \nARR today is roughly $550M and guided to ramp to $7–9B by the end of 2026 as contracted capacity comes online.  \nAI operations are already EBITDA positive with margins around 20%.\n\n**- Capex is not the problem people think it is**  \nYes, capex is massive. That is the business. But Nebius is sitting on roughly $5B in cash and raised convertibles at extremely low interest rates. Capital markets are clearly comfortable financing this growth because the demand is locked in by secured deals.\n\n  \n**- This is the most important one, everyone keeps forgetting the extra assets they own besides the cloud business**   \nMost people talk about Nebius as if it’s just an AI cloud provider. That’s missing a big part of the picture.\n\nOn top of the cloud business, Nebius still owns several assets that have real value and are basically being priced at a huge discount or in my opinion even close to zero (!!) by the market right now.\n\nAvride ($2-3B valuation) is now partnered with Uber. Avride is working with Uber on delivery robots, which is a massive market on its own.\n\nThen there’s TripleTen ($300-500M)growing fast in a high margin digital space\n\nOn top of that, Nebius still has stakes in things like AI data annotation and database tech through Toloka and ClickHouse ($2B) . These aren’t random side projects, they sit right in the AI value chain and have raised at serious private valuations in the past.\n\nIf you do even conservative sum of the parts math, you’re talking about several billion in value outside of the core cloud business. Right now, the market seems to be valuing Nebius almost purely as “AI cloud plus execution risk” and ignoring everything else. \n\nIf Nebius actually hits the target of  $7–9B ARR in 2026, you’re looking at a forward revenue multiple of roughly 2.4x for the core cloud business. While others easily have a multiple of 5-10. \n\n**- The real risks**  \nI don't want to turn a blind eye to the risk, because ofc there are:   \n\\- Data center build timelines slipping  \n\\- Customer concentration  \n\\- Share dilution over time\n\nAll real. But they are execution risks, not demand risks. Chance of execution is (in my opinion) the highest at Nebius compared to others, because of their former Yandex experience.   \n  \nThis all seems to good to be true to me, so please convince me if i'm missing something here. Even a base case should provide a valuation of roughly 120-150$ according to my research. \n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's hostile bid\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery urged shareholders on Wednesday to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, stating the offer posed “significant risks and costs” to the company while Netflix's earlier proposal held greater value.\n\nMultiple companies have previously competed for Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns numerous classic films including Casablanca and the Harry Potter series. On December 5, Netflix agreed to acquire a portion of Warner Bros. Discovery for $82.7 billion; Paramount Skydance Media Group followed suit on December 8, offering to acquire the entire media group for $30 per share in an all-cash deal.\n\nNetflix has agreed to acquire Warner Bros.' HBO and its streaming and studio businesses, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 per share.\n\nParamount Sky Dance CEO David Ellison called it “a superior all-cash offer” when proposing to acquire all shares of Warner Bros. Discovery. Ellison stated that merging Warner Bros. Discovery's assets with those of Paramount Sky Dance (parent company of CBS News) would facilitate regulatory approval.\n\nA Paramount Pictures spokesperson has not yet responded to requests for comment.\n\nWhy Warner Bros. Discovery Favors Netflix\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery advised shareholders to reject Paramount Pictures' offer, stating its board believes the regulatory risks of both acquisition proposals are comparable. The company also indicated its analysis found Netflix's proposal which includes cash and Netflix stock to be more advantageous.\n\nThis has also raised concerns about the $40.65 billion equity investment in Paramount Sky Dance Media. Warner Bros. Discovery responded by stating, “The Ellison family has made no investment commitment of any kind.” According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person with a net worth of $243 billion.\n\nShortly before WarnerMedia made its proposal, Affinity Partners one of Paramount Sky Dance's financial backers announced its withdrawal from the hostile takeover bid. Affinity is a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAn Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that while the firm still believes Paramount Sky Dance's acquisition proposal holds “strong strategic merit,” it decided to withdraw due to “significant shifts in investment dynamics since our initial participation in October.”\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, the Warner Bros. Discovery board stated it views Netflix as having superior financial health, higher credit ratings, and greater market capitalization.\n\nThe letter stated: “Netflix's merger is fully backed by a publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion and an investment-grade balance sheet.”\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery added that Paramount Sky Dance's credit rating “is at or just one notch above ‘junk’ status with two major rating agencies,” while its market capitalization stands at $15 billion.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery also expressed concerns about Paramount's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its acquisition offer.\n\n“The trust's assets and liabilities would not be publicly disclosed and could change,” it wrote in its letter to shareholders. “As the name implies, revocable trusts typically contain provisions allowing assets to be transferred at any time.”\n\nAlthough Wednesday's shareholder letter indicated that Paramount's acquisition offer is not favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide whether to accept Paramount's bid for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery, and TNT.\n\n",

Adjusted operating profit reached $6.42 billion, while cash flow from operating activities hit $8.41 billion  a stark contrast to the $3.24 billion recorded in the same period last year.\n\nAnalysts had previously forecast EPS of $3.95 and revenue of $12.95 billion.\n\nSanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Micron, stated: ‘In our fiscal first quarter, Micron achieved record revenue with significant margin improvements across the company and all business segments.’ ‘Our outlook for the second quarter indicates significant record-setting levels for revenue, gross margin, earnings per share and free cash flow, with business performance expected to strengthen further throughout fiscal 2026.

Both parties will also explore collaboration in e-commerce which, admittedly, was within my expectations.\n\nFor both parties, OpenAI can alleviate over $100 billion in computational power and talent investment pressures over the next four years while reducing its single source dependency on Nvidia chips. Amazon, meanwhile, gains a heavyweight client for its Trainium chips, bolsters its AI strategic positioning, and counters Microsoft's competitive edge.\n\nAt the industry level, this partnership could break Nvidia's monopoly in the AI chip market Trainium's cost performance advantage may reshape industry cost structures and drive down AI computing prices.\n\nSimultaneously, the formation of a tech giant alliance centered on “capital + computing power + models” will accelerate. Competitors like Microsoft and Google may intensify their countermeasures, shifting global AI competition from isolated technological rivalry to ecosystem based collaboration. Small and medium sized enterprises, along with developers, will also benefit from more accessible AI tools and services.",

      "content": "Kushner just dipped from the WBD bid mess does anything really change?\n\nI’ve been watching the Warner Bros situation, and it’s starting to feel like one of those cases where the headlines are louder than the fundamentals, except now the headlines have turned into an actual bidding war.\n\nThe latest development is pretty straightforward. Jared Kushner’s PE firm, Affinity Partners, has pulled its financing support from Paramount Skydance’s hostile bid. From what’s been reported, it was only about a $200M check in the grand scheme of things, but it still mattered. It wasn’t a big piece of the financing, but it was a politically connected name, and that backing is now gone. (News source, if you’re interested: [Netflix CEOs Defend WBD Buy, Pivot To Theaters.](https://www.moneyai-app.com/share/session?shareUuid=bf87e276-0fb9-4408-a192-da2a4daf64f3))\n\nNetflix already has an agreed deal to buy WBD at $27.75 per share, or roughly $72B. Paramount Skydance countered with a $30 per share all cash hostile offer aimed directly at shareholders. The reporting so far suggests WBD’s board is leaning toward sticking with Netflix rather than engaging with the hostile bid.\n\nWhat makes this situation feel unusual to me is that non financial factors are wrapped around the deal.\n\nParamount’s bid comes with big name backers, but it also brings political baggage. The CBS and Trump comments have pulled the deal into the public spotlight, which can slow the process down even if the headline price looks higher on paper.\n\nWBD’s Q3 2025 release showed about $9.0B in revenue, down excluding FX. The market has been watching whether improvements in streaming profitability can continue to offset the decline in linear networks, especially with the debt load still hanging over the company. That’s why Affinity walking away doesn’t really change how I read the situation. It hurts the optics of the hostile bid, but it doesn’t suddenly make the Netflix deal look worse, or make the underlying tradeoffs any simpler.",

Most of these were at their ATH a few months ago, and I’ve been patiently sitting and waiting for a good opportunity to get into the market and not buy in while most stocks were at their ATH’s.\n\nI am middle class, make about 80K annually, have about 50K in cash to my name and I wanted to buy 10K each in stocks in different sectors that seem to be down heavily right now.\n\nTech: 10K in GOOG, which today crossed under the $300 for the first time in a while.\n\n10K in Meta which is around $650 now.\n\nAerospace: 10K in RKLB, trading around $50 down from its ATH a few months back around $70.\n\nSpace and Satellite: ASTS which was trading at $100 just a little over a month ago and is now down to $60.\n\nMaterials: MP Materials which is trading around  $50 down from $100 a few months ago.\n\nI guess my question is if now is a good time to buy or if we anticipate the market to continue plummeting in the coming weeks. I would hate to lose half my investment 1 month into it and spend the next year trying to break even. I would like to hold for 1-2 years, just being honest, as I don’t think I have the patience or the capital to completely let this go of this money for 30+ years. Thanks for your help and feedback in advance. Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this. I know this sub is heavily focused on fundamentals, PE ratios, etc. and I am simply not knowledgeable enough to contribute any meaningful DD so I’m just going based off my very elementary and probably naive knowledge.\n\nThanks for your time and help in your responses.",

      "content": "NBIS; An Opportunity To Be A Generational Bag Holder\n\nHere is a company whose core business revolves around purchasing costly depreciating GPUs and renting their output out to hyper scalers such as Microsoft at a loss.\n\nTheir subsidiaries are arguably nothing but money-sinks (Clickhouse, AVride, etc.) and are outclassed by numerous competitors such as Snowflake, Starship Technologies, etc.\n\nWhile Revenue has grown 300%+ year over year, expenses have grown at a faster rate and the company is essentially burning through money.\n\n1. Secure a contract at a loss -&gt; \n\n2. Use contract to get a loan/funding -&gt; \n\n3. Build out infrastructure/acquire GPUs -&gt; \n\n4. Repeat -&gt; \n\n5. Hope to eventually become a competing AWS alternative for AI cloud solutions.\n\nThe problem: \n\nToday, the overwhelming majority of NBIS's revenue comes from hyper scalers looking to offload demand. NBIS is providing them the compute at a loss. \n\nAt anytime a hyperscaler(s) can choose to no longer use NBIS when unfavorable, which will completely cripple the company's finances.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are currently investing extremely heavily into their own data centers to keep up with demand, so the chance of Nebius acquiring customers that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, can't provide supply to in the future is low.\n\nThere is also huge uncertainty regarding NBIS's future cashflows, demand, and financial solvency. Shareholders may unknowingly be diluted to raise funds, a forced buy-out can happen, etc.\n\nOverall, NBIS is a great opportunity to become a generational bag holder. Simply ignore the financials and choose to invest off of vibes, chasing hype, etc., and you may potentially find yourself holding a bag for years to come.",

      "content": "Labor Warnings for the Stock Market\n\nThe unemployment print this week was higher than expected and is signaling an upward trend in unemployment.  Historically, the Sahm indicator has been used as a confirmation tool for \"recession\" (I use quotes because I feel the term has become more and more ambiguous in recent years) and is a measure of how unemployment is trending.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the Sahm indicator--It looks at the unemployment moving average.  Fundamentally, it takes a look at the lowest 3-month moving average over a 12-month period (currently about \\~4.2%) and compares it to the most recent 3-month moving average.  Essentially, if the current 3-month moving average is .50% (50 bps) higher than the 3-month moving average low, it produces a confirmation signal of \"recession\" with no historical false positives. \n\nThe current moving average of unemployment is \\~4.43% which puts us north of 20 bps toward the signal.  If the January 9th print is anything higher than 4.7%, there will be real concerns about the state of the economy (will put unemployment moving average at about \\~40 bps above  the moving average low).  As of today's (12/17) price action, it looks like the market is pricing in the possibility of an accelerating unemployment trend that could continue in January's print.  The Fed recently cut rates which may help reduce firing rates as cost saving measures, but January's unemployment print will be critical in understanding where the economy is at and likely where the stock market will go next.  \n\nTL;DR--If unemployment print on 1/9/26 &gt;4.7%, risk off.  If less than, likely a neutral to risk on shift.  ",

Between the ups and downs of the AI hype cycle, the volatility in crypto, and the broader market swings, I’ve had to adjust my strategy more than once.\n\nIf I had to pick one lesson that stood out, it would be this: I really underestimated the importance of cash management and balanced allocation. There were times I was too aggressive or too concentrated, and it hurt. Looking back, I wish I had focused more on building a portfolio that is steady over the long term but flexible enough to adapt when needed.\n\nCurious to hear from others.

      "content": "What’s the most persistent problem you ran into while building your business and how did you finally fix it?\n\nEvery founder I’ve met has that one annoying problem that just would not go away, the kind that quietly drains your time, energy, and sanity until you eventually crack the code. \n\nFor some people it’s hiring, for others it’s consistency, product-market fit, cash flow, whatever. So I’m genuinely curious: what was the most stubborn pain point in your startup journey, and what finally solved it for you? For me, the one thing that stuck around way longer than it should have was multi-account management. \n\nI run several niche pages as part of my business model, and juggling them was honestly way harder than building the business itself. Logging in/out constantly, mixing up accounts, browser fingerprints acting weird, random lockouts... I wasted so much time trying to manage everything manually that it actually slowed down the rest of my work. I finally solved it by building a proper setup with a few tools. The foundation is AdsPower, mostly because it lets me keep each account in its own clean browser environment without stepping on each other. On top of that, I pair it with Buffer for queued posts so I’m not scrambling all day. That combo basically removed 90% of the stress. And if anyone else is dealing with the same headache: Adspower currently has a code (reddittry) that gives you 10 new IP environments for free, which is worth testing before committing. \n\nSo what was yours? What problem kept haunting you even after you thought you’d solved it - and what finally made it click?",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-17 20:32:18  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT  \n**Bearish with Elevated Caution**  \n\n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Dominated by negative retail narratives—exit liquidity fears (AI Infrastructure), Oracle/ASML sell-offs, declining crypto activity (SOL), and political-economic concerns (energy costs, jobs).  \n- **News Flow:** Bloomberg headlines confirm a tech-led sell-off, with specific weakness in AI-related stocks.  \n- **Market Data:** NVDA down nearly 4%, VIX elevated at 16.48, and risk premium at 4.33% indicating heightened equity risk perception.  \n- **Macro Backdrop:** Fed Funds Rate at 3.64% and 10Y Yield at 4.15% reflect restrictive policy, while unemployment (4.6%) suggests softening labor market.  \n\n**Verdict:** Sentiment is **bearish**, driven by tech/AI profit-taking, political uncertainty, and macro headwinds. Retail traders are expressing frustration and defensiveness.\n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES  \n**A. AI/Technology Sector Stress**  \n- Reddit: \"Exit liquidity\" narrative, Oracle data center snag (-4%), ASML dip on China EUV reports (-6%).  \n- News: \"Tech Sell-Off Deepens on AI Stock Weakness\" (Bloomberg).  \n- Data: NVDA down sharply.  \n\n**B. Political & Macroeconomic Anxiety**  \n- Reddit: Trump policies linked to rising energy bills, blue-collar job concerns, household net worth doubts.  \n- News: Trump announces \"Warrior Dividend\" amid inflation.  \n- Macro: Elevated CPI (324.37), rising yields, and unemployment uptick.  \n\n**C. Meme Stock & Speculative Asset Volatility**  \n- Reddit: GameStop value thesis resurgence, Burry/Citadel references, Penny delisted, SOL activity collapse.  \n- Data: Extreme moves in low-volume tickers (ATPC +56%, YCBD +59%, VYNE +49%) indicate speculative froth.  \n\n**D. Corporate News-Driven Moves**  \n- Micron earnings beat (positive outlier).  \n- Spirit-Frontier merger talks, Hasbro transformation, Tepco reactor restart.  \n\n**E. Geopolitical & Regulatory Crosscurrents**  \n- China EUV tech (ASML impact), India as AI growth market, tariff challenges (Hasbro).  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Catalysts:**  \n1. **AI Infrastructure Doubts:** Oracle’s $10B data center snag and ASML’s China news are triggering sector-wide reassessment.  \n2. **Earnings Reactions:** Micron’s strong report vs. broader tech weakness suggests stock-specific divergence.  \n3. **Political Announcements:** Trump’s \"Warrior Dividend\" may be reacting to inflation/energy cost pressures.  \n4. **VIX Spike:** Movement above 16 indicates growing near-term volatility expectations.  \n\n**Underlying Signals:**  \n- Retail traders are rotating out of high-growth tech/AI into deep-value/meme plays (GameStop discussion).  \n- Debt concerns rising (Oracle debt focus).  \n- Speculative crypto activity collapsing (SOL user drop 7x).  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Tech Wreck Risk:** AI trade unwinding could spill over to broader market given high concentration.  \n2. **Political Uncertainty:** Policy volatility affecting energy, labor, and consumer sentiment.  \n3. **Credit Stress:** Rising debt focus (Oracle) amid higher rates could expose leveraged firms.  \n4. **Retail Capitulation:** Reddit sentiment shows frustration—may lead to impulsive selling or extreme speculation in meme stocks.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Contrarian Tech Entry:** Strong fundamentals (Micron) may be oversold if AI weakness is temporary.  \n2. **Defensive Rotation:** Utilities, consumer staples may benefit from energy inflation and risk-off shift.  \n3. **Meme Stock Volatility:** GameStop and low-float squeezes (ATPC, YCBD) offer high-risk tactical trades.  \n4. **International Diversification:** India AI growth, Hong Kong real estate (New World) provide non-US exposure.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**Watchlist & Actions:**  \n\n**SECTOR: Semiconductors**  \n- **MU:** Positive earnings surprise amid sector sell-off—watch for relative strength.  \n- **NVDA, ASML:** Monitor for stabilization; current news-driven sell-off may be overdone long-term.  \n\n**SYMBOL: ORCL**  \n- Debt concerns and data center delays are pressuring stock. Wait for clarity on financing and project timeline before bottom-fishing.  \n\n**SYMBOL: GME**  \n- Retail sentiment is turning positive (\"value with upside\"). High short interest could fuel a squeeze—high-risk speculative trade.  \n\n**SECTOR: Utilities/Energy**  \n- Rising energy bills (Reddit) and nuclear restart (Tepco) suggest selective opportunities in power generation.  \n\n**MACRO: Treasury Yields**  \n- 10Y at 4.15%—watch for breakout above 4.2% as risk-off signal. Consider hedging with long-duration bonds if growth fears accelerate.  \n\n**TRADING THEME: Speculative Volatility**  \n- Low-float movers (ATPC, YCBD, VYNE) show retail chasing pumps. Extreme caution—liquidity risk high.  \n\n**GLOBAL: India AI Growth**  \n- Consider ETFs or companies exposed to India’s LLM market expansion as a structural growth play.  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**  \nThe market is in a risk-off mode led by AI/tech profit-taking, political noise, and macro concerns. Retail sentiment is bearish but showing speculative impulses in meme stocks. Focus on capital preservation, selective contrarian entries in strong tech names, and tactical plays in volatile small-caps. Monitor debt markets and VIX for further stress signals.  \n\n**Next 24-Hour Catalyst:** Any follow-up on Oracle’s data center plans, Fed speakers’ comments on rates, and meme stock volume surges.",

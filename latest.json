The timing of the IPO could change based on market conditions and other factors, and one of the people said it could slip until 2027.\n\n&gt;SpaceX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n&gt;Media reports last week said the rocket-maker is kicking off a secondary share sale that would value it at $800 billion, pitting it against OpenAI for the title of the most valuable private company. However, Musk on Saturday dismissed the reports, calling them inaccurate.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/spacex-pursue-2026-ipo-raising-above-30-billion-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-12-09/",

      "content": "Global Bond Yields Hit 16-Year High on Fading Rate-Cut Bets\n\nGlobal bond markets flashed a warning signal ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Long-dated government bond yields have climbed to levels last seen in 2009, suggesting traders are starting to question whether the era of broad rate-cut cycles is actually ending. A Bloomberg index tracking long-term sovereign yields is now back at 16-year highs. Futures markets reflect that shift: expectations for additional cuts from the European Central Bank have essentially vanished, Japan is seen as almost certain to hike this month, and Australia is now priced for two more quarter-point increases next year. The move comes just as the Fed prepares to announce its next decision. While most investors still expect a cut on Wednesday, the broader message from global markets is that easing may not last as long or run as deep as previously hoped. Anyone else watching this tightening narrative re-emerge? Bond markets usually sniff out trends early, and this feels like a meaningful shift.\n\n\n\nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html)",

Here’s what to expect\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third straight meeting on Wednesday, but this one feels less straightforward than the last two. Inside the FOMC, there’s a clear split: some members want continued cuts to protect a cooling labor market, while others worry that easing too much could re-ignite inflation pressures. Beyond the rate decision itself, most of the focus will likely be on the updated dot plot and economic projections, which should give a better sense of how policymakers see the path forward. The cut looks likely, but the forward guidance may be doing most of the talking this time.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/the-fed-decision-is-expected-to-feature-a-rate-cut-and-a-lot-more-heres-what-to-expect.html?__source=androidappshare",

Here’s what to expect\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third straight meeting on Wednesday, but this one feels less straightforward than the last two. Inside the FOMC, there’s a clear split: some members want continued cuts to protect a cooling labor market, while others worry that easing too much could re-ignite inflation pressures. Beyond the rate decision itself, most of the focus will likely be on the updated dot plot and economic projections, which should give a better sense of how policymakers see the path forward. The cut looks likely, but the forward guidance may be doing most of the talking this time.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/the-fed-decision-is-expected-to-feature-a-rate-cut-and-a-lot-more-heres-what-to-expect.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

Me\n\nI used timers, reminders, texts, I was talking to that thing all day and apparently, during those first years, only certain areas were involved in the data review program and I happened to live in one of them. During that time I had a mac, an iphone, an ipad and another portable mac (old but I used it) so even more devices and \"damage\" according to the class action\n\nSo I check the settlement details in an app and see the payout estimates.

WeRide received L4 driverless city permit in Abu Dhabi, outside of US. They turned their permits and reg approvals into real operating advantage. We can clearly see that WeRide is the first mover and leader in those countries. Working with Grab and Uber to operate their fleets gives them an access to huge target bases. Also, WeRide enters ADAS market, partnered with Bosch gives them more credibility in the auto market. \n\nInstitutional side: recently, ARK Invest purchased 858,295 shares of WeRide and extra 17,326 shares bia ARKQ. BofA, City and BOCI all applied a BUY rating on this stock, showing a long-term confidence in them. Their shareholders include: Fidelity, Greenwoods, Hudson Bay, Invesco, M&amp;G, Mirae Asset, Morgan Stanley IM, Temasek, and NVIDIA.\n\nThis is a super heavy capital industry and not cheap to operate. It's not realistic to expect them to have profits right away. However, when you look closely into their strategy, their partnerships and especially their Q3 performance, you can see the numbers have been improving quarter to quarter. Imo, this company is having a huge potential in the whole auto space in the next few years, they doing the real things instead of saying and doing nothing on press.",

      "content": "Mastercard (MA) broke into our Top 5 Quality Picks for the first time since August. Here's the breakdown.\n\nWe've been running a scoring algorithm on S&amp;P 500 stocks since August. Basically scores companies on fundamentals and how they stack up against sector peers, then runs them through some validation checks. Only 5 stocks make the cut each month.\n\nMastercard broke in for the first time at #5 on 1st December. The profitability on this thing is genuinely ridiculous. 196.9% return on equity, 45.3% net margins. Scored perfect marks on returns and margin efficiency. Analysts are bullish too: 49 of 62 have it as a Buy, with literally zero Sells, and the consensus implies about 21% upside.\n\nThe problem is valuation. Stockoscope DCF puts intrinsic value around $382  based on 12.9% growth for 5 years, followed by 5 years of tapering growth to 2%, discounted at 8.1% (and it's trading at $537 currently). That's a pretty big premium to pay, even for something this high quality. The growth would have to be around 20% for it to be fairly valued.  \n  \nTechnicals: Currently, it is down 11% from the highs, and there is a nice support  around the 500 levels, which would be around a 16% drop from the top. That would be a better entry than the current level, of course.\n\nCurious where others land on this. The quality is undeniable, but it's a bit pricey. \n\nNot financial advice. DYOR.",

On the face of it, a 40% downward guidance revision would justify a 40-50% price drop\n* The break down of EPS revision and remediation are indicated below.

      "content": "Trump opens the floodgates, and NVIDIA's H200 can finally be sold to China\n\nOn December 8, Trump posted on Truth Social, allowing NVIDIA to sell H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China, with the condition that the U.S. government takes a 25% cut. The previous H20 only had a 15% cut, but this tim\n\nLet me break down this situation for you:  \n  \nByteDance and Alibaba are both lining up to place orders. Reuters reported on December 10 that these two companies have already asked NVIDIA for large bulk orders. But Beijing hasn't made a statement yet—Chinese regulators called in Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent for a meeting on December 9-10, asking about their demand volumes, saying they'll \"give a reply soon.\"  \n  \nThe H200 is 6 times more powerful than the previous H20. The AI training performance gap is 6.7 times—this isn't a joke. Huawei's Ascend 910C? Its training capability is only 60% of the H200's, a huge gap. Those Chinese outfits working on big AI models? Without NVIDIA's cards, they're basically limping along.  \n  \nHow much can NVIDIA's EPS rise? Wells Fargo did the math: if the China market opens up, that's $25-30 billion in annual revenue, pushing EPS up by $0.6-0.7. Current analyst predictions assume zero China revenue—this is pure gravy.  \n  \nBut supply is a big issue. NVIDIA's putting all its capacity into Blackwell and Rubin right now, so H200 inventory is super low. Even if Beijing approves it, it'll be a slow rollout, not a sudden flood.  \n  \nMy take: Beijing will approve it, but only for the top players (ByteDance, Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu)—small companies will still have to stick with Huawei's. This is \"selective opening\"—they want AI competitiveness without fully relying on U.S. tech.  \n  \nThe funniest part? U.S. senators are pushing the SAFE Chips Act again, wanting to ban NVIDIA from selling H200 to China for 30 months. Trump just greenlit it, and now Congress wants to overturn it—this is like the left hand slapping the right.  \n  \nBottom line: FY2027 EPS forecasts are conservative; adding the China piece, an extra $0.3-0.4 bump is no problem. Right now, NVDA's trading at 24x forward PE, 31% growth rate, PEG of just 0.77—way cheaper than the S&amp;P 500's 1.61.  \n  \nIf you haven't bought NVIDIA yet, this wave of China market opening is the catalyst. But don't expect an instant surge—you'll have to wait until after Q2 2026 to see the real cash flow.",

      "content": "Amazon plans to invest $35 billion in India and create 1 million jobs is this good news for AMZN?\n\nAmazon announced it will invest over $35 billion in India and create 1 million jobs by 2030. This represents a significant commitment, clearly signaling a long term dedication to deepening its presence in India.\n\nThis move appears to have dual implications for Amazon:\n\nPositives: India's e-commerce demand continues to grow rapidly. Large scale investment could accelerate Amazon's market share and logistics advantages locally. Long term, it may become a new growth engine.\n\nRisks: The massive investment and long return cycle, coupled with India's intense competition and complex regulations, may not necessarily translate into profits. The short term boost to stock prices could also be limited.\n\nI see this as a classic case of long term upside with short term uncertainty.\n\nDoes this news make you more optimistic about AMZN's long term value? If you're a shareholder, would you increase your position or remain cautious?",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-10 09:02:05 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral-to-Bearish with Retail Skepticism**\n\nThe sentiment is bifurcated. **Institutional and macro data suggest a cautious, data-dependent stance**, with moderating labor costs and a stable VIX (~17) indicating contained near-term volatility. However, **retail sentiment (from Reddit) is decidedly skeptical and fatigued**, with posts like \"honestly just sold everything. this market feels fake\" and discussions of \"Forever Layoffs\" pointing to a loss of confidence among individual traders. The repeated, high-scoring focus on GameStop's fundamentals suggests a defensive, contrarian retail posture clinging to specific narratives amid broader uncertainty.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES: **Monetary Policy Uncertainty, Geopolitical Risk, and Niche Convictions**\n\n*   **Monetary Policy & Economic Outlook:** Dominant theme. The Fed's rate cut trajectory (Reddit #1, RSS #4) and moderating labor costs (RSS #9) are central. The forward view is clouded, with Pimco suggesting the Fed will be \"on hold\" through 2026.\n*   **Geopolitical & Fiscal Risk:** A significant undercurrent. Reddit discussions on Europe potentially dumping U.S. Treasuries in response to U.S. foreign policy shifts (#2) introduce a tail risk of bond market disruption and dollar weakness.\n*   **Retail Conviction Plays:** Concentrated fervor around specific assets: **GameStop (GME)** is highlighted for its sustained operational turnaround (#3, #6, #15). **SpaceX's potential 2026 IPO** (#5, #12) is a major future liquidity event. **Crypto** sentiment is mixed, with regulatory/political moves (Texas reserve #10) contrasted with builder disillusionment (#7).\n*   **Search for Yield & Defense:** RSS feeds are saturated with content on high-yield, low-volatility ETFs and income strategies (#5, #6, #7), indicating a risk-averse, income-seeking orientation among financial media consumers.\n*   **AI/Defense Spending:** The Palantir (PLTR) Navy contract (#4) reinforces the ongoing, real-world monetization of AI in the defense sector.\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS AND CATALYSTS\n\n*   **Primary Catalyst (Macro):** The path of **Federal Reserve policy** post-current easing cycle. The signal from Pimco (RSS #4) for a prolonged hold in 2026 is more hawkish than some market whispers and could limit equity upside.\n*   **Risk Catalyst (Geopolitical):** Watch **UST 10Y Yield (4.17%)** for any upward pressure from foreign official selling rumors. This is a low-probability, high-impact signal.\n*   **Sector-Specific Catalysts:**\n    *   **Aerospace/Defense:** Goldman's note on Loar Holdings (LOAR) (RSS #10) and the Palantir deal signal sustained sector strength.\n    *   **\"Meme\" Equities:** **GameStop's (GME)** consistent positive earnings are fueling a fundamental re-assessment narrative among its shareholder base, which could lead to volatile, sentiment-driven price action disconnected from broader markets.\n    *   **Future IPO:** **SpaceX's 2026 target** sets a long-term horizon for private market validation and public market absorption of a mega-cap issue.\n*   **Contrarian Signal:** The extreme retail skepticism (\"market feels fake\") could serve as a contrary indicator if macro data stabilizes, suggesting weak hands have already left.\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Geopolitical Financial Shock:** An accelerated sell-off of U.S. Treasuries by allied nations would spike yields, pressure equity valuations, and strengthen headwinds for rate-sensitive sectors.\n    2.  **Policy Mistake / Stagflation:** The Fed holding rates \"on hold\" (RSS #4) amid a weakening labor market (\"Forever Layoffs\") risks a policy error that stifles growth.\n    3.  **Retail Capitulation:** Widespread retail selling could remove a source of market liquidity and exacerbate downturns, particularly in high-retail-ownership names.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Defense & AI Convergence:** Companies like **Palantir (PLTR)** securing large government contracts represent tangible revenue streams in a uncertain macro climate.\n    2.  **Income & Quality:** The market is directing attention to high-yield, low-volatility instruments (RSS #5-7). This favors large-cap dividend payers and selected REITs.\n    3.  **Idiosyncratic Turnarounds:** Stocks with strong self-improvement narratives (e.g., **GME** showing operational discipline) may trade on company-specific metrics, offering insulation from macro flows.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n\n*   **SECTOR: DEFENSE/AEROSPACE** - Favor companies with visible government contract backlogs and AI integration. The Palantir deal and Goldman's LOAR note are reinforcing signals.\n*   **SECTOR: LOW-VOLATILITY / HIGH YIELD** - In a market hungry for income and stability, ETFs and stocks screening for high dividend yield with low beta are likely to see continued interest. Monitor flows into funds like the Invesco ETF mentioned (RSS #5).\n*   **GME: Monitor for Decoupling** - GameStop's price action may increasingly decouple from broader market sentiment. Watch for sustained high retail discussion volume paired with institutional analyst coverage changes as a volatility signal.\n*   **MACRO: WATCH THE 10Y-2Y SPREAD & VIX** - Any steepening of the yield curve (2s10s) or a spike in the VIX above 20 would confirm the bearish retail sentiment is spreading to institutional portfolios, warranting a defensive posture.\n*   **AVOID: SPECULATIVE CRYPTO** - The mixed signals (Texas adoption vs. builder exit) and \"unhinged\" political discourse (Reddit #8) suggest high volatility and non-fundamental drivers dominate. Prefer regulated, equity-linked crypto exposures if any.\n*   **FUTURE CATALYST: SPACEX SUPPLY CHAIN** - As the 2026 IPO approaches, research public companies in SpaceX's supply chain (e.g., aerospace components, advanced materials) for potential re-rating.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is in a holding pattern, awaiting clearer signals on 2026 monetary policy. Institutional money is defensive and yield-seeking, while retail is skeptical and focused on niche narratives. **Tactical opportunities exist in defense and yield, but overall portfolio positioning should remain cautious, with heightened monitoring of geopolitical bond market risks.** The sentiment gap between institutions and retail is itself a key market dynamic.",

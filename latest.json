      "content": "Amazon releases an impressive new AI chip and teases a Nvidia-friendly roadmap\n\nAmazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs.\nThe cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at its AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product in on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.\n\nAWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation, according to AWS.\nAWS says the systems are more than four times faster, with four times more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10 times the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. \nPerhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation.  While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.\nIt is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscience way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  \nAWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, Splashmusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. \n\n\nAWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step-up in performance and support Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  \nThis means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon’s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  \nIt’s worth noting, too, that Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), has become the de facto standard that all AI apps support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon’s cloud.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/",

      "content": "OpenAI declares ‘code red’ as Google catches up in AI race\n\nThe Verge, Dec 2, 2025\n\nGoogle’s own ‘code red’ response to ChatGPT has started paying off.\n\nThe tides are turning in the AI race, and the pressure is getting to OpenAI. Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in.\n\nIn the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said.\n\nThere will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development.\n\nThe newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.\n\nSource: https://www.theverge.com/news/836212/openai-code-red-chatgpt",

Like literally the whole thing runs on “confidence,” “sentiment,” “vibes,” whatever you wanna call it. Earnings matter yeah, interest rates matter yeah, but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it’s worth buying. People hold because they trust it’ll go back up. People panic because they think someone else is panicking.\n\nIt’s like one giant circular trust fall. Everyone is basically agreeing not to look down.\n\nAnd then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense? Like not a normal recession or correction, but a day where enough people say “nah I’m done trusting this casino.” Would everything just… unwind? Would indexes tank for years? Would governments step in and force something? Or does the system somehow survive because it’s too big to fail, like people will keep believing simply because they have no choice?\n\nIdk maybe I’m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is. Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating?",

Their cloud unit just launched **Trainium3**, a new processor designed to run heavy AI model training at a lower cost and higher efficiency than Nvidia’s GPUs at least according to Amazon.\n\nThe pitch seems clear: companies want cheaper AI compute, and Nvidia’s pricing + demand backlog is still insane. If Amazon can offer decent performance for less, there’s definitely a market for it.\n\nBut there’s a catch.  \nTrainium3 doesn’t have anything close to Nvidia’s software ecosystem. CUDA and the entire Nvidia stack are still massive moats, and they’re the reason companies can deploy models quickly without rewriting everything. Amazon doesn’t have that luxury yet.\n\nIis Nvidia’s dominance still unshakeable because of the ecosystem lock-in or you think Amazon actually becomes a real competitor in AI hardware",

He frequently referenced the market being way too expensive consistently sitting at 20-25X earnings, and mentioned several times that the USA had reached its “apex” (peak) and indexes may not be wise investments as the nation may see prolonged stagnation in terms of growth and earnings — which is why he spent the last chapters of his life seeking value in China, which seemed to disappoint him just as many times as it helped him due to the strict corporate regulations and oversight. \n\nI know it’s just one grumpy old man’s opinion, but it’s very disheartening to see a man who went from bankrupt to billionaire in a little over 30 years, largely through marketable securities, almost blow off the future of investing. He stated numerous times that the upcoming generation should be ready for a lot of disappointment in the markets. \n\nThoughts?",

      "content": "A 'seismic' Nvidia shift, AI chip shortages and how it's threatening to hike gadget prices\n\nAnalysts are starting to flag a new concern: the AI boom is beginning to strain global chip supply chains in a way that could eventually push up the cost of consumer electronics — including smartphones. AI data centers require massive numbers of GPUs and supporting components, and companies like Nvidia, AMD, Google, and Microsoft are all drawing from the same pool of suppliers. As demand accelerates, several parts of the supply chain are struggling to keep up. Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu recently described the situation as “undersupply,” pointing to shortages across chip manufacturers, memory suppliers, and storage device makers and said the bottleneck could last two to three years.\n\nConsultants at Bain &amp; Company highlighted two immediate pressure points: **Hard disk drives (HDDs):** Hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft have pushed HDD capacity to the limit. **Solid-state drives (SSDs):** With HDDs running short, big cloud companies are shifting toward SSDs the same components used in consumer electronics. On top of that, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a stacked version of DRAM crucial for Nvidia’s latest AI chips, is also in tight supply. These constraints ripple backward through the semiconductor ecosystem and raise the cost of parts used in everyday devices. As AI infrastructure spending surges, several key components are facing multi-year shortages. That raises the risk of higher prices — or even limited availability — for some consumer tech products if supply doesn’t catch up soon.",

Speaking at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo, Son said he “was crying” as SoftBank offloaded the stock, which brought in roughly $5.83 billion.\nAccording to Son, the sale wasn’t about lack of confidence in Nvidia. Instead, SoftBank needed the capital to fuel massive upcoming AI investments, including larger bets on OpenAI, data-center infrastructure under the Stargate Project, and its chip ambitions via Ampere Computing. Son reiterated that SoftBank is “all in” on AI and hinted that the firm may expand its OpenAI investment depending on future valuations. SoftBank’s focus on AI has already paid off the conglomerate’s Q2 net profit more than doubled, aided by valuation gains tied to OpenAI. Despite growing market concerns about a potential AI bubble, Son dismissed the skepticism, saying those calling it a bubble are “not smart enough.” He predicts that advanced AI systems and AI robotics could eventually generate at least 10% of global GDP, justifying the scale of current investment.For Son, selling Nvidia shares wasn’t a statement about the chip giant it was a sacrifice to fund what he sees as the next wave of global technological transformation.",

      "content": "Trump expects the Federal Reserve chair nominee to be announced “early next year” and praised Hassett.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his choice for Federal Reserve chair in early 2026 and hinted that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett could be his pick, further fueling speculation about the next leader of the U.S. central bank.\n\n“We may announce the new chair of the Federal Reserve early next year,” Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting.\n\nLast week, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Hassett was considered a potential successor to Powell, and Trump also endorsed this position at another event shortly after Tuesday's cabinet meeting.\n\n“I guess the potential candidate for Fed chair is here too,” Trump said. “I don't know who qualifies for the word ‘potential.’ I can tell you he's a respected individual. Thank you, Kevin.”\n\nTrump's remarks provided a clearer timeline for an announcement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bechtold, who has overseen the selection process, previously indicated the candidate could be revealed around Christmas.\n\nThe president said Tuesday that after consulting with Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Luteinik, he had considered about 10 candidates for the position, but now “we've narrowed it down to one person.”\n\nHowever, it is well known that Trump frequently makes unexpected personnel and policy decisions, meaning the nomination cannot be considered final until formally announced. Other candidates included Federal Reserve Board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Riddell.\n\nFor months, Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's term expires in May, and appointing his successor will be Trump's biggest opportunity yet to reshape the Fed. Trump has criticized Powell for being too slow and cautious on rate cuts, expressing hope that his replacement would push for reductions more aggressively.\n\nTrump again criticized Powell on Tuesday, calling him a “stubborn guy who probably doesn't like your president.” Although Powell's term as chairman ends next year, he could remain on the board as a governor for two more years.\n\nIn September, Trump explicitly named Hassett, Wash, and Waller as his top three candidates. Trump has also repeatedly expressed his desire for Cent to serve as Treasury Secretary, but the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly declined the offer.\n\nThe selection of the Federal Reserve Chair and Board members typically represents the most direct avenue for the President to influence the central bank. However, Trump has consistently criticized the Fed publicly for its sluggish response in lowering borrowing costs and for spending lavishly on renovating its headquarters. Additionally, the White House has filed a lawsuit over Trump's attempt to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\n\nWhoever Trump selects as Fed chair will require Senate confirmation. If the nominee is an outsider, they are likely to receive a 14-year term as a Fed governor, beginning February 1.",

      "title": "Greencoat UKW",
      "content": "Greencoat UKW\n\nThere is constant criticism that this sub doesn't contain high quality posts anymore so as the newest member to the mod team I thought I would do my best to be a part of the solution. If you would prefer to view the thesis somewhere more pleasing to the eye and including relevant graphs and figures then here is a google docs link: [Greencoat UKW](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vST_XMTNnE6VXIs34kI2eqEGNMlPCtUQNJ3CU55bC5Rh1jioh0XW7hy9gCroQ0rmf716Kp-NEKt94QR/pub)\n\nNo AI was used in the making of this other than running calculations that I double checked.\n\n\n\n# Fund Summary\n\nGreencoat UK Wind PLC is a renewable infrastructure fund, invested exclusively in UK wind farms. The fund’s aim is to provide investors with an annual dividend that increases in line with RPI inflation while preserving the capital value of its investment portfolio in the long term on a real basis through reinvestment of excess cash flow.\n\nThe fund is one of the few FTSE 250 listed stocks to raise their dividend for nearly 10 years straight and very well positioned to sustain the dividend growth through the high inflationary period due to revenues being explicitly and implicitly tied to inflation.\n\n# Section 1) Reasons for Discount to Market Cap\n\n# Interest Rates\n\nFor the first \\~7 years of the fund’s life since IPO in 2013 the share price has traded at a modest premium to the NAV however since 2022 that has changed. Over the last 3 years the stock price has slowly traded at a larger and larger discount to NAV with the latest calculation being 140.7p NAV and 99.65p SP meaning a (41.05/140.7p​)×100≈29.17% discount to current NAV.\n\nWhen the “risk free” rate for investors increases, investors demand a higher-dividend yield to assume the risk of owning the fund instead of long term government bonds. Therefore, the stock is sold off until the dividend yield hits a premium more worth the risk. To represent this in the NAV, the fund changed the discount rate it used to calculate current value of future cash flows. NAV is highly sensitive to the discount rate of future cash flows as that causes the current value of those cash flows to be worth far less. As you can see from the 10 Year Gilt rates, 2022 is when the yields started rising due to geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine, which means the discount rate that they used for their calculation of NAV went up from 7% (2021) to 11% (2024) and is the main cause for the declining NAV in that period.\n\nIn their most recent half yearly report, Greencoat state that 0.5% increase in interest rates has a 6.3p negative effect on NAV. While this is offset by increased revenues due to inflation-indexed subsidies and higher realised price per MW/H, it’s overall a largely negative effect on current value of future cash flows.\n\n# Switching to CPI from RPI\n\nThe government is trying to switch everything to track CPI instead of RPI, as it’s the global standard and also reduces its costs. In 2020, it confirmed that the inflation indexed bonds that were previously issued would be switched without any compensation for bond holders.\n\nThe government recently started a discussion into whether payments under the RO and Feed In Tariff schemes should also be switched to CPI. It is also considering freezing rates until backdated “shadow” CPI levels catch up. This would hugely affect renewable energy providers and, as stated by UKW, would drop the NAV by 2.4p for an instant switch to CPI at current levels and by 10.6p for freezing and re-aligning with the “shadow” amount.\n\n# Reduced Average UK Wind Speeds\n\nOver the past 4 years, wind speeds in the UK have been lower than average. This has caused power generation to be well under budgeted estimates and has resulted in lower-than-expected cash flows and therefore smaller dividend cover. This has meant less excess cash to re-invest to maintain NAV and is also likely a cause for investors being cautious in believing NAV calculations.\n\n# Section 2) Management\n\n# Cost of Management\n\nEffective from 1 January 2025, the management fee for running the fund has been based on the lower of the NAV or Market Cap. This is a very shareholder-friendly change which means the management fees are cheaper when the share price is trading at a discount. Based on the earlier calculation of discount to NAV, this means that the fees are also ≈29.17% cheaper.\n\n# Capital Allocation\n\nCapital allocation at the fund since the IPO has been fantastic. They have continuously made decisions that boost the NAV. During periods where the share price was trading at a premium to NAV per share, they did equity financing (share dilution) to raise capital and buy more assets. Whilst many shareholders see dilution as bad for shareholders, when it’s done at above NAV it is accretive for NAV per share.\n\nSince the shares have recently started trading at a discount to NAV, Greencoat have been doing buybacks with excess cash flows because this also increases the NAV per share by reducing shares outstanding. The fund’s ability to be dynamic with its capital allocation will allow them to continue outperforming the market in the long run. The increase in the size of the market for UK wind assets is also likely to provide opportunities to get assets at great prices going forward, as a lot of capital will be required in the industry.\n\n# Section 3) Key Risks\n\n*In no particular order:*\n\n**1.Change from RPI to CPI:** The biggest near-term risk is the potential shift in the indexation measure from RPI to CPI. These will be accounted for in my calculation of expected returns below.\n\n\n\n**2. Reduction of average UK wind speeds:** ([UK wind power potential could fall by 10% by 2100 because of climate change - Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-wind-power-potential-could-fall-2100-because-climate-change/)) There are some studies that suggest we could see lower average wind speeds going forwards, due to climate change. The fund has reduced their estimation of future average wind speeds even though there is no real conclusive evidence that it will happen.\n\n\n\n**3. Valuation Risk:** The fund doesn’t disclose exactly how they calculate NAV and there is some risk that they have made overly optimistic assumptions in this calculation. It’s hard to pin these down but here are some potential worries:\n\na) **Consistently Overestimating Power Generation:** As listed in the ‘UK average wind speeds’ section above, every single year going back to 2016 the fund has underdelivered on power generation, even when UK average wind speeds were higher than expected. This could suggest some incorrect assumptions in the NAV.\n\nb) **Decommissioning Liabilities:** (Source: [Greencoat Flapping in the Wind - by David Turver](https://davidturver.substack.com/p/greencoat-flapping-in-the-wind)) \n\n“Note 10 to their accounts identifies about £280m of guarantees and indemnities made by the company to cover things like decommissioning and other indemnities. However, Note 2 records that they consider the fair value of these indemnities to be zero because they “do not expect Group cashflows to crystalise as a result of these guarantees”.\n\nHowever, this might not be the full extent of the under-recording of decommissioning liabilities. For instance, Note 10 indicates a guarantee to the Crown Estate of £3.4m for the decommissioning of Rhyl Flats offshore wind farm. However, the 2023 accounts for[ Rhyl Flats](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/05485961/filing-history) shows the present value of decommissioning liabilities of £29.2m. Grossing this up using their discount rate of 3.75% to the expected life of 23 years gives an expected cash cost of some £40.7m in 2032. UKW owns 24.95% of Rhyl Flats, so its share of the total would be £10.2m, three times more than the amount recorded in Note 10.\n\nSimilarly, they record in Note 10 a guarantee of £11.8m to cover decommissioning and rent for[ North Hoyle](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/02904841/filing-history) wind farm. However, the 2024 accounts declare a provision for decommissioning with a present value of £12.1m. Grossing this up to their discount rate of 6% out to 2034 gives a cash cost of £21.7m. UKW owns 100% of North Hoyle, so it will be on the hook for the entire amount, nearly double the recorded guarantee.”\n\n\n\n**4.Political Risk:** The conservative party has stated that they would scrap certain renewable subsidies if they were in government and Reform would likely try to do the same. Whilst these subsidies are bound by contract and likely hard to legally get out of, this still poses a risk of impacting future cash flows. The only way to account for this would be to use a lower growth rate for NAV in expected returns as a form of margin of safety.\n\n\n\n**5. Assets Life Risk:** The fund lists asset life as one of its keys risks and says “In the event that the wind turbines do not operate for the period of time assumed by the Group or require higher than expected maintenance expenditure to do so, it could have a material adverse effect on investment returns.\n\nThe Group performs regular reviews and ensures that maintenance is performed on all wind turbines across the wind farm portfolio. Regular maintenance ensures the wind turbines are in good working order, consistent with their expected life-spans.”\n\n\n\n**6. Electricity Prices:** Quite obvious, but a material drop in energy prices for an extended period of time would substantially hurt the fund’s cash flows. This risk feels very small to me – with huge data centres the increased load to the grid for electric cars and a widespread shift away from fossil fuel generation demand for power is very likely to stay high. They are also calculating NAV based on their realised price per MW/H dropping from £60 down to below £40 in 2060.\n\n# Section 4) Expected Returns\n\nTo make it easy, I will just calculate NAV and assume dividends are left in cash within the fund. (Rate of return will be higher if, at below NAV, dividends are re-invested and/or buybacks happen.)\n\n# Optimistic Outlook: Share Price Returns to NAV within 3 years and NAV grows at 10% (The fund’s target)\n\n**Current Share Price:** 99.65p\n\n**NAV After 3 years:** 187.27p  \nEnding NAV=140.7p×(1.10)\\^3=187.27p\n\n**Total Return Over 3 Years:**  \nTotal Return=(Ending NAV/Starting SP)​−1 =(187.27p/99.65p)​−1≈1.8793−1=87.93%\n\n**Annualised Rate of Return (CAGR):**  \nCAGR=((1+Total Return)\\^⅓)−1  \nCAGR=((1.8793)\\^⅓)−1≈0.2340=**23.40%**\n\n# Base Case: Switch to CPI instantly (-2.4p NAV), Share Price Returns to 90% of NAV within 3 years and NAV grows at 8%\n\n**Current Share Price:** 99.65p\n\n**NAV After 3 years:** 174.22p  \nEnding NAV=138.3p×(1.08)\\^3=174.22p\n\n**Total Return Over 3 Years:**  \n Total Return=(Ending NAV/Starting SP)​−1 =(174.22p/99.65p)​−1≈1.7483−1=74.83%\n\n**Annualised Rate of Return (CAGR):**  \nCAGR=((1+Total Return)\\^⅓)−1  \nCAGR=((1.7483)\\^⅓)−1≈0.2047=**20.47%**\n\n# Pessimistic Outlook: Freeze at current rate and switch to “shadow” CPI Rate (-10.6p NAV), Share Price Stays at current discount to NAV and NAV grows at 8% for 3 years\n\n**Current Share Price:** 99.65p\n\n**Starting NAV** 130.1p\n\n**Nav After 3 Years:** 174.22p  \nEnding NAV=130.1p×(1.08)\\^3=163.89p\n\n**Current Discount:** 1−(99.65p/140.7p)=**29.17%**\n\n**End Price with Discount:** 163.89p\\*(1-0.2917)=116.08p\n\n**Total Return Over 3 Years:**  \n Total Return=(Ending NAV/Starting SP)​−1 =(116.08p/99.65p)​−1≈1.1649−1=**16.49%**\n\n**Annualised Rate of Return (CAGR):**  \nCAGR=((1+Total Return)\\^⅓)−1  \nCAGR=((1.1649)\\^⅓)−1≈0.05=**5%**\n\nFor this pessimistic outlook to be true, the worst-case decision for the switch to CPI would need to happen (this would hugely disincentivise future investment in renewables, making net-zero 2050 and clean power by 2030 a lot harder to achieve) plus the fund would have to miss its target returns by 2% annually. I’ve chosen 2% to account for the fact that Greencoat have missed their generation estimates by an average of 2.4% since 2013. In their 2024 annual report they revised future estimated wind speeds down by 2.4% (conveniently similar) but I’m just being conservative. All of this, as well as the fund still trading at a 29% discount to ending NAV, means I calculate the CAGR is still 5%.\n\n# Section 5) Potential Tailwinds Not Included\n\nAll of the above is very much looking into worst case scenarios, I'm very much of the opinion that 1st priority in investing should be making sure that you don’t lose money and the upside will take care of itself. That being said here are some of the things that could materially increase returns:\n\n1. Reduction in interest rates would hugely boost NAV. For example, if interest rates in 3 years were 2% then that would add 26.8p to current NAV.\n2. Rise in electricity costs would increase dividend coverage and allow buybacks and potential acquisitions of new sites to increase NAV – or simply allow for special one-time dividends like they have done in the past (should be a last resort if no other capital allocation is available at high compound rate of returns).\n3. An expected increase in on-shore windfarms by 2x and off-shore by 3x means that constructors will be looking for lots of buyers to free up capital to start on new projects, potentially creating opportunities for effective use of capital at higher rates of return.\n4. Buybacks at current prices are VERY efficient due to the discount to NAV and reduce the dividend burden by reducing shares outstanding.\n5. The stock price could return to NAV at a faster rate than 3 years, which would make CAGR for the investment higher but over less time.\n6. Stock price could return to trading at a premium to NAV like it did for the first 7 years of the fund's life.\n7. Battery storage on site at wind farms could increase returns by allowing flexibility for delivering power at periods with the highest demand. This currently does not offer good rates of return but as battery technology improves it’s something the fund is investigating. (Wind power provides the best opportunity for this as a lot of power is generated overnight during periods of low demand)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThanks very much if you got this far, you have a much better attension span than most, please do let me know what you think and no need to be too kind, feel free to rip my thesis apart.\n\nI do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.\n\nI have taken a 20,000 share position and will be looking to build on it should there be any further discount to the stock price.",

      "title": "Berkeley Group PLC",
      "content": "Berkeley Group PLC\n\nHi,\n\nCheck out my writeup. I struggled (a lot!) getting to grips with the UK homebuilders so would appreciate any feedback. Be brutal!\n\n[Berkeley Group PLC - by Harshu Vyas - Contrarian Stocks](https://contrarianstocks.substack.com/p/berkeley-group-plc).\n\nAlso, pasted below (without images - couldn't get them in for some reason):\n\nBerkeley Group is a UK homebuilder focused on brownfield regeneration (brownfield land is previously developed land that’s no longer being used, including disused industrial estates or factories) that trades on a trailing earnings yield of 10%, a forward P/E of 11x and roughly book value.\n\nSee their impressive 20 year track record below and note the consistent profitability:\n\nIt gets better when you consider management’s anticipated GM of £6.7 billion in the land bank at a market cap of £3.6b with net cash. (Although, in this industry it’s very hard to count cash as your own since management will always be keen to deploy it on land where they can.)\n\nTwo pieces about Berkeley specifically stood out to me -\n\nFirstly, the geographic focus on London makes sense to me. London house prices typically appreciate faster than the rest of the UK due to consistent high demand coupled with [shortages of rentals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgkg54nd5d5o). However, London has underperformed since 2016 following Brexit and Covid.\n\nI view the underperformance of London as temporary. A reversal in WFH behaviour could potentially trump affordability concerns (i.e shorter commutes is better than less sleep in a bigger bedroom). Further, London is home to some of the world’s top schools and universities meaning talent will always be in swaths around London looking to get their foot in the door. And, despite anti-immigrant propaganda, London remains the UK’s biggest magnet for globally mobile workers.\n\nWhilst it’s true that London gets lots of bad press due to public concerns (crime, antisocial behaviour, homelessness), these problems are fixable. If 1970s New York could be turned, London certainly can. The location (financial district, nightlife, culture) is simply too important meaning it’s unfeasible to write off London. A bet on London flourishing (which is highly likely with a long-term horizon) in turn means a bet on London property prices increasing.\n\nBerkeley feel a similar way. With a track record of “being greedy when others are fearful” and vice versa Berkeley returned to [buying land last year](https://www.constructionenquirer.com/2024/07/30/berkeley-back-buying-land-after-over-two-year-pause/) after a two year sabbatical.\n\nSecondly, brownfield regeneration has its perks. Brownfield sites tend to be in or near existing urban areas meaning there’s naturally more demand compared to the typical homebuilder and [UK national policy ](https://thenegotiator.co.uk/news/uk-housing-market-news/more-than-5000-new-homes-promised-in-brownfield-building-drive/)pushes councils to prioritise brownfield delivery.\n\nThe cons are obvious. It’s complex. High upfront spending (remediation, planning, land assembly) and long pre-construction phases result in more time, more working capital and higher financing exposure than a typical volume site.\n\nDespite these challenges, Berkeley Group was named the UK’s number one homebuilder in 2025 for build quality by HomeViews, the only independent review platform dedicated to residential developments in the country.\n\nAs usual, there’s a twist. Whilst the “cheap” accounting misleads you to the “right answer”, the reality is more nuanced —\n\nReported profits of UK homebuilders can look impressive, but they miss the most important economic cost: the return investors require while their capital sits locked up for years in land and WIP. To understand real performance, you have to revalue earnings after charging this “time” cost.\n\nThe correct lens is simple:\n\n1. Identify the capital actually tied up.\n2. Apply the company’s Cost of Capital (COC) to it.\n\nThe most accurate capital base is Average Capital Employed (ACE) because it reflects the net funding from shareholders and lenders. It excludes customer deposits and long-term land creditors, which are effectively free financing. ACE represents the pool of investor capital that must earn at least the required return.\n\nThe COC - here, a punishing 12.5% discount rate - captures the risk and duration of multi-year regeneration projects. Applying this rate to ACE produces the annual “capital charge” that should be deducted from reported profit to reveal the economic return.\n\nOnce this adjustment is made, the picture changes dramatically. For FY2025, the capital charge absorbs most of the reported margin, cutting a 27% accounting gross margin to around 11% and reducing a 16% “headline” pre-tax ROCE to roughly 3% (post-tax).\n\nIn other words, much of the profit reported under accrual accounting is simply the required reward for waiting. And here strong accounting profits leave little surplus once ongoing reinvestment in land and construction is funded.\n\nHowever, on the exact same framework, looking back to the period 2015-19, Berkeley on average earned over £325m post-tax, pre-working capital adjustments (compared with £75m over the last two years). That’s the proof that this is not a bad business!\n\nThe bleak reality for Berkeley is that their capital base has swelled whilst their turnover has stayed the same. So whilst the obvious point to make is on margin compression (GM from mid-thirties to mid-twenties), it’s the WIP that’s grown 82% between 2015 and 2025 and the average capital employed swelling from £1.3b to £3.1b in a decade - whilst revenues have only grown 1.6% CAGR - that should really strike.\n\nCash due on forward sales (under unconditional contracts) has also decreased for three years straight - and in an inflationary environment the net result is worse - from £2.2b in 2022 to £1.4b.\n\nAs with any business, “through-the-cycle” cash flow is the true measure. To reiterate my thesis, we’re close to trough conditions in terms of both Berkeley’s ability to build and sell at the best prices.\n\nThe accounting doesn’t get less complicated here -\n\nLand purchased for development is recorded at cost. Once moved into production, development costs are categorised as WIP. Units completed but not yet sold are included in inventory as completed stock. When a property is sold, the corresponding expenditure recorded in inventory is expensed through cost of sales. However, the nature of the business model is that it is common for Berkeley to sell homes before they are built, a practice known as forward selling. Management says their “*customer deposit strategy remains 20% for forward sales*.”\n\nFurthermore, deposits are typically collected when the customer enters into an unconditional contract for sale, usually taking place during the early production phases, years prior to completion.\n\nOf course, this alludes to the problem discussed earlier. When a builder bills revenue so early on in a multi-year development, they leave themselves exposed to build cost inflation. And there’s no evidence to suggest that Berkeley’s contracts contain explicit price escalation or price-hike clauses for forward sales.\n\nHowever, the poor performance seen today - that most seem to miss - is not indicative of the business. Using the same discount rate and tax rate for the period 2015-19 paints a completely different picture where Berkeley had an average ROCE greater than 27%! Real returns would have been even higher through that period through lower taxes and lower interest rates. Despite Berkeley trading at over 2.5x book in 2015 the stock roughly doubled between then and Covid.\n\nObviously, I’m not writing to look back at the past nostalgically to remember a “what-has-been.” But I’m showing you this isn’t an awful business. Just a capital-intensive, cyclical business. The reality is that this is a cyclical at trough prices. It’s hard to see how it gets “worse.”\n\nAs Exec Chair, Rob Perrins, wrote in The Times “[Today’s crisis is even worse than after the 2008 financial crash](https://www.thetimes.com/business/companies-markets/article/how-fix-london-housebuilding-h6qv3cxr3).” He blames regulatory costs, taxes and planners for killing development and urges the Labour government to change their ways. He’s right. Capital turns have always been slower than the US. And they’re getting slower.\n\nIt was a politically charged article, no question. But I found it very interesting that other homebuilders “blame” other factors, more commonly on the demand side. Persimmon, for example, seem able to increase output but are struggling to sell due to “[affordability constraints and increased industry-wide costs](https://www.thetimes.com/business/companies-markets/article/persimmon-warns-its-profit-margins-may-not-match-city-forecasts-zp6mshz8c).” Bellway reiterated these concerns saying that the government must “[address the demand-side constraints](https://www.thetimes.com/business/companies-markets/article/bellway-repeats-call-for-return-of-help-to-buy-nml8qd68v).” Barratt and Taylor Wimpey were also mentioned in these articles calling for demand-side stimulus.\n\nInterestingly, Berkeley haven’t really complained on this front. But completed units have swelled from £30m to over £300m between 2015 and 2025. That said, whilst Berkeley have struggled with containing cost of sales operating expenses have consistently been around 6-8% of sales.\n\nDespite all of the above, there is a path to light.\n\nFirstly, inflation seems to be under control and interest rates are set to get cut. More in-line build costs allows Berkeley to maintain margins, stabilise the capital base and borrow cheaply (which will be important for optionality in the BTR segment). Furthermore, politically, the Labour government have pledged to build 1.5m homes which the [OBR have revised down to 1.4m](https://www.bigissue.com/news/housing/autumn-budget-labour-housebuilding-housing-pledge/). I don’t expect government to get close to that figure but when a government tends to favour an industry, it shouldn’t hurt.\n\nSecondly, looking towards the future, Berkeley’s management have identified and set aside £7b of free cash flow - available to the business from existing reserves and trading activity - to be allocated over the next decade. £2.5b is to be spent on land, £2b is to be spent on shareholder returns, £1.3b is unallocated and £1.2b is to be spent on their BTR platform.\n\nLet’s just pause for a second here because this capital allocation framework is precisely the crux of this investment thesis.\n\nThe issue is that management have chucked out this figure and it’s very hard to understand the practicality of this. Pecking order theory is in full effect here. We don’t know exactly how management have determined any of the above. What even is their end goal here?\n\nAnalysts and investors both are forced to trust management’s judgement.\n\nNote that pre-tax profit guidance for FY26 is £450 million with FY27 likely to be similar, both of which are lower than 2025 (a poor year, as discussed above).\n\nThis is important because if we lazily assume that capex and depreciation is de minimis meaning that tax profits are roughly cash profits (pre-working capital adjustments since management have set aside cash for land) you have a business earning £315m FCF in 2026 and 2027.\n\n(Note that average working capital investments between 2015 and 2025 were about £100m.)\n\nEven the poorest mathematician amongst us can figure out that to get to that £7b FCF figure, between 2028 and 2035 Berkeley will have to throw off about £800m/annum in FCF.\n\nHowever, markets haven’t reflected this claim either because they missed it (unlikely) or they don’t trust it (highly likely). As I showed you above, such a return would require a rapid acceleration of the London housing market from where we are currently. £800m/annum for seven years seems ridiculous.\n\nTherefore, if we take the £315m for ‘26 and ‘27 and then assume “high but achievable earnings growth mimicking previous booms:\n\n2028: £450m, 2029: £450m, 2030: £650m, 2031: £650m, 2032: £900m, 2033: £900m, 2034: £800m, 2035: £800m\n\nEven in this scenario where earnings pretty much triple over a decade, we still end up short of that “identifiable” £7b FCF!\n\nIn order to try to understand where this figure came from, I went back to the future gross margin figure. Remember management have estimated future gross margin at £6.7 billion across 52,700 homes. Well, at 8% admin expenses and a 29% effective tax rate (corporate + RPDT), that’s only £4.2b NOPAT, assuming that it’s in line with FCF.\n\nThe answer can only come from the pipeline that comprises c.12,000 plots implying that £2.8b NOPAT will come from here.. which seems highly unlikely. At a conservative £500k/plot and a 22% GM, NOPAT totals about £830m. Meaning that I’ve only found £5b “free capital” to be deployed.\n\nThat said, if the above were true, Berkeley would only trade at a 14% NOPAT yield through the decade - with net cash unaccounted for - which seems very reasonable.\n\nWhat is most interesting to me is the BTR platform. Berkeley’s strategy is designed to unlock value by turning its brownfield pipeline into an income-producing platform. Under the Berkeley 2035 plan, up to £1.2b will be deployed over the next decade to deliver 4,000 high-quality rental homes - meeting unmet demand in and around London.\n\nThe model is straightforward: Berkeley builds, leases and stabilises assets before deciding the optimal exit route. By holding each building for at least four years beyond completion, Berkeley captures rental growth, establishes a rental premium based on its build quality and ultimately sells (or refinances) a proven, income-generating asset at full investment yield. This approach avoids the typical 20% value erosion seen in forward-funded Private Rented Sector (PRS) deals, where values are fixed two years in advance and priced with risk discounts.\n\nA dedicated BTR team, combining Berkeley leadership with external hires, has already secured six planning consents to refine layouts and amenities for renters. The first scheme launches in spring 2026.\n\nOnce stabilised, each asset sits on a platform offering multiple exit strategies: selling individual buildings or curated portfolios, bringing in third-party equity while retaining management, or introducing debt secured against the rental assets. This optionality reduces risk and maximises capital efficiency.\n\nWhilst this is all well and good, it’s theoretical. What are the returns of such a plan?\n\nThe strategy unlocks two profit streams.\n\nFirst, by developing and stabilising the assets themselves, Berkeley avoids the typical 20% discount embedded in forward-funded sales. Since the £1.2 billion build cost represents 80% of full value, the stabilised portfolio is worth roughly £1.5 billion, generating a one-off £300 million development profit.\n\nThe second layer comes from a planned four-year hold. Assuming a conservative 3.5% net yield and modest rental growth, the stabilised £1.5 billion portfolio would produce around £220 million in cumulative rental profit over the hold period.\n\nPut together, the plan turns a £1.2 billion capital deployment into roughly £520 million of total cash profit… but time reduces the economic profit. However, given we don’t know the exact details this is a first best guesstimate of what I think is reasonable and is very likely to change in the future as we get more information.\n\nManagement are aligned with Executive Chairman, Rob Perrins, owning over 1.25m shares (over £40m) having joined in 1994 and CEO, Richard Stearn, owning 250k shares (over £8m) having joined since 2002.\n\nManagement have also been buying shares on the open market recently. Rob Perrins has bought about £1.1m in the last year with Richard Stearn buying over £400k. Do management believe the stock to be cheap even though near-term profits seem to be poor?\n\nWhilst incentives and financial transactions don’t always show the result, they usually indicate where a company may land. And I like what I see.\n\nOf course, I had to know what London was thinking.\n\nAs of last week, [GS started Berkeley at ‘sell’ with a £37 price target](https://www.voxmarkets.com/articles/goldman-starts-coverage-of-six-uk-housebuilders-with-constructive-outlook-a3482b8). They pointed to constrained earnings growth given the low viability of residential London development, burdened by slower house price growth, more regulation and low affordability. They also said BTR will take time to contribute to earnings with capital recycling also taking longer.\n\nMaybe Goldman are right. But our time horizons are different.\n\nRisks:\n\n1. Market conditions do not ease. Inflation persists, interest rates remain high, cost-of-living gets worse. Berkeley do not generate the £7B FCF that their future is built on. They fail to generate sufficient shareholder returns.\n2. BTR model - which is new to Berkeley - has execution errors or is the wrong strategy. However, Berkeley weren’t doing brownfield through their whole history and I’d rather buy a company internally developing something than acquiring something you may not know everything about.\n3. Political tailwinds do not materialise meaning that even with macro improvements, it’s difficult to develop sites.\n\n(It’s also true that brownfield regeneration projects are inherently risky. However, Berkeley have historically been very good at it and if their discipline continues, this risk can stay low.)\n\nTo conclude, Berkeley is in dire straits just like the other homebuilders. However, downside is protected because of the balance sheet that management are using to break the market shackles by force (while maintaining £300m net cash for at least until FY26). A savvy capital allocation framework that is geared towards resharpening the business coupled with longer-term political and macroeconomic tailwinds results in a potential compounder at a trough, albeit high-looking, multiple.\n\nBest investing,\n\nHV\n\n(Modelling the future accurately is tricky but management’s track record gives me faith that Berkeley are on the right track. This lack of visibility probably makes Berkeley more of an “uncomfortable” hold compared to some of my other positions because the results aren’t in the current financials yet.)",

(I’ve previously always just held to maturity). \n\n\nHold to maturity: \n\nIncome is state/local tax free. \n\nSell the bond for a profit on the secondary market: \n\nIncome is effectively a short term capital gain where both state/local and federal taxes apply. \n\n\nSo in California where my state taxes are ~10%, I should only sell the bond if the face value of the bond is 10% lower than the secondary market price. \n\nIs my understanding correct here?",

      "content": "Invest in ETFs or 5.75% mortgage, or both?\n\nHi all,\n\nI’ve been browsing several investment and homeowner subs and I’m still unsure what makes the most sense financially. From what I’ve read, the consensus seems to be that the decision basically depends on mortgage interest rate. Seems like ~6% is sort of the grey area. Ours is 5.75%.\n\nA little over a year ago, I got a much better job so my income level is relatively high but I’ve only recently been able to contribute meaningfully (pretty much at all) to retirement and savings. Right now, I’m maxing my Roth IRA, HSA, and 401(k). We also just bought a house with a 5.75% mortgage. From what I understand, investing in broad ETFs like VTI and VXUS would historically yield more than 5.75% in the long run (like ~8%?), so I could potentially grow my wealth faster by investing. I feel a bit behind in savings for my age (31) and could afford to put money in now to try to catch up.\n\nBut, I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal, especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later. I’m wondering if it’s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns, or if there are other factors I should consider. Maybe it is best to do some of both? \n\nThank you!",

Usually the really fast-growing stuff happens in private markets first, and by the time they IPO, most people miss out. One ETF called XOVR is a crossover ETF that mixes private companies with public companies to give earlier exposure. Has anyone tried this kind of ETF? Does it actually help spread risk, or is it more complicated than it sounds?",

This is money I have plans for in the short term, so I want to keep it invested conservatively.\n\nMy question is, am I better off investing in NY munis instead? I know you need to consider tax brackets, but when looking at the current yield for VNYTX, it is very close and maybe even more then SGOV. So if the yield is the same, tax brackets don't really matter, why wouldn't you invest in VNYTX and save on both Fed AND State tax?\n\nI know there must be a catch or reason, I just don't know what it is.

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-02 15:25:27  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT  \n**Overall Sentiment: Bearish with Elevated Anxiety**  \n\n- **Reddit Retail Sentiment:** Highly agitated, with multiple posts signaling systemic risk fears (e.g., repo market \"flashing red,\" collateral stress, bank insolvency concerns). GME warrant/call activity and brokerage restrictions (Schwab) suggest retail is focused on potential market dislocations and speculative squeezes.  \n- **News Flow:** Cautious tone from institutional sources (Pimco’s \"caution,\" Oracle credit fear gauge at 2009 highs, AI bubble warnings). However, IPO activity remains robust (UltraGreen.ai, Medline, JD.com unit), indicating capital markets are still functioning.  \n- **Macro Data:** VIX at 17.24 is elevated but not panicked. 10Y yield at 4.09% and Fed Funds at 3.89% show a still-restrictive policy environment. Equity Risk Premium of 4.33% suggests equities are compensating for risk, but not excessively.  \n- **Conclusion:** Sentiment is bifurcated—retail is bearish/nervous, while institutional channels show selective optimism (IPOs, AI upgrades) amid clear warnings. The net tone is risk-off with a focus on fragility.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES  \n**A. Systemic & Collateral Stress**  \n- Reddit highlights repo market stress, banks dumping MBS for cash, and unrealized losses threatening solvency. This echoes broader concerns about financial system resilience.  \n\n**B. AI & Tech Dichotomy**  \n- **Positive:** Amazon’s new AI chip, Nvidia’s \"comeback story,\" Vistra upgraded to investment grade due to AI-power demand.  \n- **Negative:** Oracle’s credit fear gauge spikes on AI bubble fears; AI narrative is both a driver and a risk.  \n\n**C. Political & Policy Uncertainty**  \n- Trump-related headlines (affordability \"scam,\" USDA funding pause, tariffs) and companies (e.g., Costco) suing for tariff refunds point to election-driven policy volatility.  \n\n**D. Speculative & Meme Activity**  \n- GME warrants/options anomalies, Robinhood gambling critique, and crypto volatility (Bitcoin +$91K, bearish bets wiped) show retail is active in high-risk corners.  \n\n**E. IPO & Capital Markets Activity**  \n- Strong pipeline (UltraGreen.ai, Medline, JD.com supply-chain unit) indicates investor appetite for new issues, contrasting with systemic worries.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Signals:**  \n1. **Credit Stress Signal:** Oracle’s credit default swap (CDS) at highest since 2009—a clear warning on corporate debt, especially in tech/AI.  \n2. **Repo Market Alert:** If accurate, overnight repo stress is a near-term liquidity red flag, often preceding volatility spikes.  \n3. **Retail Broker Behavior:** Schwab restricting GME1 call buying may signal regulatory or internal risk management concerns about derivatives exposure.  \n4. **Bitcoin Rally:** Rapid short squeeze (+$91K, $140M bearish bets vanished) suggests crypto is acting as a sentiment gauge—sharp moves often correlate with equity volatility.  \n5. **Single-Stock Volatility:** INTC up 8.65% on no major news (per data) could indicate positioning reversals or sector rotation.  \n\n**Catalysts Ahead:**  \n- IPO launches (UltraGreen.ai, Medline) will test risk appetite.  \n- Political headlines may drive sector-specific moves (e.g., agriculture, trade-sensitive stocks).  \n- Any Fed or Treasury response to repo market strains would be critical.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Liquidity Crunch:** Repo market stress could accelerate if collateral concerns worsen, impacting bank funding and broad market liquidity.  \n2. **AI Bubble Burst:** Oracle’s CDS spike and bubble warnings suggest the AI trade is overextended; a correction could drag tech-heavy indices.  \n3. **Retail Frenzy Unwind:** Concentrated speculative bets (GME, crypto) could unravel violently, causing cross-asset contagion.  \n4. **Political Volatility:** Election-related policy uncertainty may freeze corporate investment and consumer spending.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Defensive Rotation:** Elevated VIX and risk premium may create entry points in quality large-caps with low debt.  \n2. **IPO Selective Participation:** Strong IPO pipeline indicates pockets of capital availability; due diligence on fundamentals is key.  \n3. **Dislocation Plays:** Any repo-driven selloff could create oversold conditions in solid credits.  \n4. **Energy/Utilities:** Vistra’s upgrade highlights AI-power demand; energy infrastructure may benefit.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**Watchlist & Actions:**  \n\n- **SECTOR: Financials** – Monitor bank stocks and credit ETFs (e.g., XLF, KRE) for signs of collateral stress. Avoid regional banks with high commercial real estate exposure until repo concerns clarify.  \n- **SYMBOL: ORCL** – Oracle’s CDS spike is a canary in the coal mine for tech debt. Consider reducing exposure to highly leveraged tech names.  \n- **SYMBOL: NVDA** – AI narrative remains powerful but bifurcated. Hold core positions but hedge with options given bubble warnings.  \n- **SYMBOL: INTC** – Today’s 8.65% move warrants scrutiny for news (earnings, contracts). Could be a catch-up trade; consider taking profits if no catalyst emerges.  \n- **ASSET: Bitcoin** – Crypto volatility is high; treat as speculative satellite only. A break above $91K may signal further risk-on momentum, but beware of sudden reversals.  \n- **THEMATIC: IPOs** – Track UltraGreen.ai and Medline debuts for market risk appetite. Strong performance could temporarily calm nerves.  \n- **ACTION: Raise Cash** – Given conflicting signals (systemic fears vs. IPO boom), increasing liquidity to 5–10% provides flexibility for potential dislocations.  \n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** The market is sending conflicting signals—systemic worries are rising, but capital markets remain open. **Tactical caution is warranted.** Prioritize capital preservation, hedge concentrated positions, and prepare for volatility spikes. Watch overnight repo rates and Oracle CDS for early stress indicators.",

      "content": "Carvana $CVNA is Highly Fraudulent\n\nCredentials:  14 year automotive veteran.  15 year options trader\n\nBullet Points:\n\n1) Carvana’s profit margins are too good to be true.  The best companies in the industry don’t come close to their 19% gross profit margins.  \n\n2) The CEO of Carvana (Ernest Garcia III) Also owns a privately owned auto business named Drivetime.  Drivetime is a dumpster fire.\n\n3) Ernest Garcia III has been funneling his unwanted Carvana inventory to Drivetime to prop up Carvana’s earnings.  Drivetime overpays Carvana for this inventory and then takes the loss on their own balance sheets.\n\n4) Over the last few months Ernest Garcia III has been selling tens of millions of dollars of stock to keep Drivetime afloat\n\n5) Carvana has issued roughly 15.3 million shares over the last year.  At average $330 price this comes to roughly 5 Billion USD.  None of this reflects on the company’s financial report.  \n\nThesis:\n\nBased on CVNA October 2025 earnings report the company’s equity attributed to shareholders increased by 1B usd.\n\nIn the same period the company issued ~15.3 million shares worth over 5B usd.  None of this issuance reflects on the company’s balance sheets.  Healthy companies issue dividends and buy back stock.  Carvana has no dividend and has issued billions in stock solely to their core insiders.\n\nDrivetime (a company owned by Carvana’s CEO) has the worst inventory I have ever seen.  Thousands and thousands of cars that are absolutely overpriced garbage.  Some of the cars they have been sitting on for over 6 months.  \n\nIn October and September of 2025 Ernest Garcia III has sold roughly 82 million dollars of carvana stock.  \n\nI am not a private investigator, financial pro, or accountant, but to me the evidence is compelling that carvana’s results are being directly propped by DRIVETIME and once the Garcias have enriched themselves the real results will emerge.\n\nI plan to open short positions against CVNA in the next few weeks after they fully transition to the SP 500",

Waymo is one of the largest positions in Tiger’s 2024 fund.\n\nWaymo declined to comment.\n\nThis year, Waymo has also announced a slew of expansions, including its debut on freeways in three cities, and autonomous driving in cities including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando.\n\nThe latest milestone is also another sign that Waymo is continuing to push ahead of aspiring self-driving competitor Tesla, which has run limited pilots in Austin and operates a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area.\n\nTesla vehicles include human drivers or safety supervisors on board and are not driverless like Waymo’s fleet vehicles.\n\nAccording to Tesla’s latest earnings call, executives said the company hit a quarter of a million miles with its fleet in Austin, and more than one million in the Bay Area. In July, Waymo announced 100 million total fully autonomous miles.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html)",

The arrests are part of a wider investigation into what officials say is a network designed to bypass U.S. export controls on advanced technology. Separately, a Houston-based company and its owner have already pleaded guilty to routing Nvidia hardware through shell buyers to evade restrictions. Investigators say the broader probe now involves more than $160 million worth of export-controlled tech. It’s another reminder of how tight controls around AI and high-end chips have become, and how aggressively enforcement is picking up as demand keeps rising.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/us-attorneys-office-southern-district-of-texas-prosecutors-nvidia-chips-h200-h100-smuggle-china.html?__source=androidappshare",

      "content": "Michael Saylor just pitched countries on creating Bitcoin backed digital banking systems and the concept is pretty wild.\n\nSpeaking in Abu Dhabi, Saylor laid out a vision where countries could use Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit to offer regulated bank accounts that give way higher returns than traditional deposits. He pointed out that banks in Japan, Europe and Switzerland barely pay any interest while US money market funds are around 4%. People are basically disgusted with their bank accounts which is why corporate bonds exist.\n\nHis proposal involves structuring accounts with about 80% digital credit instruments, 20% regular currency, and an extra 10% buffer to reduce volatility. The digital credit layer would be backed by Bitcoin reserves with about 5 to 1 overcollateralization. Basically using Bitcoin as the ultimate collateral layer.\n\nSaylor thinks a country that implements this could attract $20 to $50 trillion in deposits and become the digital banking capital of the world. Thats not a small claim.\n\nHowever theres obvious skepticism here. Bitcoin is down 28% from its recent highs and dropped 9% over the past year. The volatility makes people question how you can build stable high yield products on top of it. One former bond trader called Saylors moves folly and said hiking rates to maintain a peg wont work when people want their money back during a panic.\n\nStrategy already has a product called STRC that works somewhat like this - its grown to $2.9 billion but faces doubts about whether it can handle a real liquidity crunch.\n\nThe idea is innovative but feels like it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating long term to actually work. What happens during extended bear markets?",

My allocation is 70/20/10 which feels right but the mental clarity from simplifying was honestly the best part, I don't spend hours reading earnings or arguing online anymore, I check everything with blossom now and my returns have been totally fine, just buying more shares monthly and ignoring the noise, nothing crazy but steady…\n\nIf you're on the fence about going full bogle I'd say just do it, the peace of mind is worth more than chasing extra returns",

With the missing October data, and the compromised November data, I actually think they might opt to hold rates steady until they have a more complete data set in January. From their point of view there is no harm in waiting; one month won't make a big difference in the long term. Looking at the most recent reports, the data doesnt seem to support the notion that inflation is coming down or that joblessness is much worse than it was earlier this year--look at the charts. I'm sure a lot of you want to tell me that the job market is trash, and I agree, but it's not in the data. And we definitely can't be certain that tariffs are gone for good. I'm preparing for a bloodbath this Wednesday, maybe even the beginning of the AI crash. ",

The decision partially rolls back restrictions that had previously barred shipments of Nvidia’s A100, H100, and H200-class GPUs to Chinese customers over national security concerns.\n\nUnder the revised rules, Nvidia may resume sales of the H200 so long as exported configurations fall within newly defined performance limits and comply with enhanced government monitoring. The adjustment follows weeks of uncertainty, during which Nvidia executives repeatedly emphasized that final export approval would ultimately come from President Trump.\n\nChina represents 20 to 25% of Nvidia’s data-center revenue. Restoring access even partially could meaningfully lift 2026 sales guidance.",

Price vs. Value (The Behavioral Trap)** *\"Price is what you pay; value is what you get.\"* This is the hardest psychological hurdle. We are biologically wired to view a rising price as validation and a falling price as failure. Value investing requires decoupling these two. I try to view \"Mr. Market\" as a tool to be used, not a guide to be followed. If he offers a discount, I buy. If he’s manic, I ignore him.\n\n**2. The Margin of Safety (The Engineering)** Graham’s \"Rule #1.\" It’s basically engineering redundancy for your portfolio. If you buy a dollar for 50 cents, you can be wrong about the growth rate, management, or macro headwinds and *still* not lose money. It’s not just about maximizing upside; it’s about pre-calculating the downside so you survive the mistake.\n\n**3. Quality over \"Cigar Butts\" (The Pivot)** Early Graham focused on \"cigar butts\" (dying companies that were cheap). Buffett and Munger evolved this. It is far better to buy a *wonderful* company at a fair price than a *fair* company at a wonderful price. Time is the friend of the wonderful business and the enemy of the mediocre one.\n\n**4. The \"Latticework\" (The Edge)** Investing isn't just finance. Munger’s concept of the \"Latticework of Mental Models\" suggests that if you only know accounting, you’ll fail. You need to understand psychology (biases), history (cycles), and probability. The best investors are \"learning machines\" first and analysts second.\n\n**5. Temperament &gt; Intellect** You can have a 160 IQ and go broke if you can't control your emotions. The ability to do nothing for 2 years while holding cash, or to buy when the headlines are apocalyptic, is a temperament skill, not an IQ skill.\n\n**My Takeaway:** Whenever I make a mistake, it’s usually because I violated #2 (paid too much) or #5 (got impatient).\n\n*I wrote a longer breakdown with some visual aids and the full quote collection here if you want to bookmark it:*[https://humblepics.com/what-is-value-investing/](https://humblepics.com/what-is-value-investing/)",

Although it’s the default “VOO and chill” which is a little boring, it’s relatively reliable and stable as a compounder and captures the overall strength of the US economy.\n\n- QQQM as the turbocharger for growth. Yes, VOO already has tech, but I see QQQM as a deliberate overweight into the sector which beats the broad market over the long run. I’m still on the boat that the tech sector will continue to thrive exponentially.\n\n- VXUS to capture everything non-US related. Europe, Japan, emerging markets, developed Asia. When the dollar weakens, when US valuations get too hot, when global cycles differ, VXUS is my ballast and the global hedge so I can ensure that I’m not betting my entire future on just one country.",

      "content": "Some companies that I find interesting as of late\n\nHey, so if you don't know, I post more a lot in the daily threads over at r/stocks. I do like to write from time to time and have written a few posts in the past. One was around what I have learned along the years of investing, with like how I screen and how I research things.\n\nMy approach is kind of a blend of Lynch and Buffet, where I'm a GARPy style investor. I don't mind paying fair price for something, like Buffet would say \"**It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price\".** So when I screen, I like to look for companies with a PEG under 2 and have high ROIC with growing revenues.\n\nMore than happy to share my screener as well.\n\nI think a big part of becoming a successful investor is having to research. I actually enjoy doing this, since this can basically be a free hobby. You get to learn more about the world around you, plus just different industries.\n\nI also feel like this is one area you can do well, is finding some under the radar names that have little no analyst coverage.\n\nBelow are some stocks I just find interesting, Doesn't mean you should go out and buy these names, but rather just highlighting some companies you probably have never heard of and just to bring up for the sake of discussion.\n\nSo here are those companies:\n\n**BK Technologies Corp**\n\n[https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/bkti/statistics/](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/bkti/statistics/)\n\nSmaller company, but fundamentals are pretty solid. I have a thing for small float companies with good or high insider ownership. This company fits that, with only 2.97M shares available on the float with 13% insider ownership. Also has like no debt.\n\nReally strong numbers the last 4 quarters with revenue growth not being that great, but with gross margins and operating margins really improving as well as ROIC is looking really strong.\n\n[https://quickfs.net/company/BKTI:US](https://quickfs.net/company/BKTI:US)\n\nBasically the company makes two way land mobile radios. They basically sell to all the federal agencies and have strong connections with them. Part of the story is the company outsourcing manufacturing which has led them to have less inventory, better margins and improved their working capital.\n\nLatest investor presentation:\n\n[https://storage.googleapis.com/vendorgroup-assets/site/7ada4fe6-a4f7-4e86-9996-2496b9a16c77/2025/11/14/6917b28bb189d74a2140312e/BK%20Investor%20Presentation%20November%202025%20FINAL.pdf](https://storage.googleapis.com/vendorgroup-assets/site/7ada4fe6-a4f7-4e86-9996-2496b9a16c77/2025/11/14/6917b28bb189d74a2140312e/BK%20Investor%20Presentation%20November%202025%20FINAL.pdf)\n\n**Synchrony Financial**\n\n[https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/syf/statistics/](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/syf/statistics/)\n\nMuch larger market cap here, with this one being 28B. Overall, it's a pretty cheap valuation for the company with the forward and trailing PE both at 8, with a PEG at 0.56. This company basically does financing and branded credit cards for retailers, making them more of a niche play.\n\nThis one is a basically really boring compounder that has the risks of all credit names, but just offers a really cheap valuation.\n\nLatest quarter presentation:\n\n[https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_c50e3de2621b1ea575f46ab042c83ac6/synchrony/db/3606/33918/presentation/3Q%2725+Earnings+Presentation\\_vFINAL.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_c50e3de2621b1ea575f46ab042c83ac6/synchrony/db/3606/33918/presentation/3Q%2725+Earnings+Presentation_vFINAL.pdf)\n\n**Brainsway Ltd - ADR**\n\nThis one is way more speculative of a name and not cheap, but the PEG is still about 1.04, since the EPS growth has been great.\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BWAY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BWAY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)\n\nROIC is a bit lower, but the company is what new to being profitable, but still seeing double digits revenue growth since Sep 2023. It has been a bit more normalized the past four quarters, around 27% growth QoQ.\n\nAnother name is little debt, around 6.75M, but has 70M in cash &amp; cash equivalents.\n\nOverall, I just find this company really interesting, what they do almost sounds fake. It offers Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation platform technology for the treatment of major depressive disorders, anxious depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, smoking addiction, bipolar disorders, post traumatic stress disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, post stroke rehabilitation, and Parkinson’s diseases.\n\nThis is all FDA approved as well.\n\nTheir latest investor presentation:\n\n[https://investors.brainsway.com/static-files/2902f3d8-e9b7-4fb1-9114-4e0c60d993a3](https://investors.brainsway.com/static-files/2902f3d8-e9b7-4fb1-9114-4e0c60d993a3)\n\n**Flotek Industries Inc**\n\nJust opened a position in them this morning. They've been on my screener for a bit, but never looked into them. I tend to stay away from oil &amp; gas names, really just own like one name in the space, FTI (which is another fun company)\n\nValuation isn't too bad by any means:\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FTK](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FTK)\n\nWhat is wild about this company, is the explosive growth they are seeing because they are basically going all into their data analytics side of things.\n\nKind's of wild how much this has changed up the companies growth. Gross margins went from like 18.3% in Sep 2024 to 31.7% Sept 2025. Same thing happened with operating margins, going from 5.5% to 16.5% that same time period. ROIC is also looking great and the EPS growth is really impressive.\n\n[https://quickfs.net/company/FTK:US](https://quickfs.net/company/FTK:US)",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-09 09:31:56  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT  \n**Bullish with Elevated Speculative Froth**  \n\n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Overwhelmingly speculative and momentum-driven. High-scoring posts highlight large options bets (e.g., \"30K SPY YOLO,\" \"NFLX 40k OTM\"), earnings excitement (\"Happy Earnings Day!\"), and retail fascination with single-stock moves (e.g., NVDA, CVNA fraud accusations). The tone is optimistic but naive, indicating strong retail FOMO.  \n- **Macro/Technical Data:** Supportive for risk assets—equity risk premium at 4.33% remains attractive, VIX subdued at 16.66, 10Y yield at 4.14% is stable. However, unemployment (4.4%) and delayed PPI data introduce mild uncertainty.  \n- **RSS News:** Neutral-to-positive institutional tone (e.g., upgrades for IBM, real estate recovery themes), but no overwhelming bullish catalysts.  \n\n**Overall:** Bullish sentiment driven by retail speculation, but underlying fundamentals show modest growth with pockets of risk.\n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES  \n**A. Geopolitical/Trade Policy Impact**  \n- Trump’s comments on NVDA H200 chip sales to China (multiple Reddit posts) and threats of tariffs on India (\"dump rice\") suggest trade policy is a live market catalyst, particularly for semiconductors and agriculture.  \n- RSS news notes unchanged soybean export outlook after China sales resume—aligns with theme of U.S.-China trade dynamics.  \n\n**B. AI/Semiconductor Momentum**  \n- NVDA is a focal point across Reddit (chip sales news) and market data (NVDA listed in top movers). AI leadership and export policies are key drivers.  \n\n**C. Retail Speculation & Options Activity**  \n- Reddit dominated by large, bullish options bets (SPY, NFLX OTM calls) and meme-style commentary (\"apes,\" \"YOLO\"). This indicates high-risk, high-reward retail positioning.  \n\n**D. Disconnect Between Economy and Markets**  \n- Reddit post: \"Economy is dragging, but the stock market is thriving. Why?\" reflects confusion over strong equities amid modest macro data (unemployment 4.4%, CPI elevated).  \n\n**E. Earnings and Event-Driven Volatility**  \n- \"Happy Earnings Day!\" posts suggest retail is focused on short-term earnings plays. RSS highlights earnings reactions (e.g., IBM upgrade post-Q3).  \n\n**F. Sector-Specific News**  \n- Autonomous vehicles (Waymo vs. Tesla), fintech (beaten-down stock with hedge fund buying), and real estate (Ares, JPMorgan) are active themes in RSS feeds.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Catalysts:**  \n1. **NVDA-related news:** Trump’s comments on H200 sales to China could impact semiconductor supply chain and NVDA stock (already slightly down -0.32% in snapshot).  \n2. **Earnings season:** Retail is eagerly watching earnings (Reddit posts), with potential for high volatility in meme stocks or heavily traded names.  \n3. **Delayed PPI data** (Reddit): May cause uncertainty in inflation tracking, though CPI remains elevated (324.368).  \n4. **Treasury auction ahead** (RSS): Could impact bond yields and equity valuations if demand falters.  \n\n**Technical Signals:**  \n- VIX at 16.66 suggests low fear, but retail options activity (SPY, NFLX OTM calls) indicates complacency—a contrarian warning.  \n- Gold (GLD) at 386.98 is stable; no strong safe-haven bid.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Risks:**  \n1. **Retail Overexuberance:** Extreme options bets (e.g., NFLX 40k OTM) and YOLO-style trading could lead to sharp reversals if momentum stalls.  \n2. **Geopolitical/Trade Uncertainty:** Tariff threats (India, China) and semiconductor export policies may trigger sector volatility.  \n3. **Economic Data Delays:** PPI delay adds opacity to inflation outlook, risking Fed policy mispricing.  \n4. **Single-Stock Fraud Narratives:** Reddit accusations against CVNA could spark social-media-driven sell-offs, regardless of fundamentals.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **AI/ Semiconductor Leadership:** NVDA and chipmakers may benefit from approved China sales (25% cut to U.S.).  \n2. **Beaten-Down Sectors:** RSS notes hedge fund buying in fintech down 70% and real estate recovery—value opportunities.  \n3. **Earnings Volatility:** Selling premium in overhyped earnings plays (e.g., meme stocks) could capture inflated options pricing.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**Watchlist & Actions:**  \n\n- **NVDA:** Monitor price action around $184.96; Trump’s China sales approval could be a near-term catalyst. Watch for institutional flow to confirm retail hype.  \n- **SPY:** Extreme bullish options positioning (\"30K YOLO\") suggests a potential short-term top. Consider hedging long exposure with VIX calls or put spreads.  \n- **SECTOR: Semiconductors:** Trade policy news will drive volatility. Favor large-cap semis (NVDA, AMD) over small-caps due to geopolitical risks.  \n- **SECTOR: Real Estate:** RSS highlights recovery (Ares) and institutional bets (JPMorgan Boston tower). Look at REITs and commercial real estate ETFs for value.  \n- **CVNA:** High Reddit attention with fraud accusations—avoid or short if sentiment sours further, but beware of squeeze potential.  \n- **ECONOMIC DATA:** Delay in PPI means focus on upcoming CPI revisions and Fed speakers for inflation clues. Position for yield curve steepening if data softens.  \n- **RISK MANAGEMENT:** Reduce exposure to highly short-dated OTM options (e.g., NFLX 40k calls) favored by retail; instead, sell premium or use defined-risk spreads.  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**  \nMarket is bullish but fueled by retail speculation, creating pockets of overvaluation. Trade policy (especially semiconductors) and earnings are key catalysts. Risks include geopolitical surprises and retail-driven volatility. Favor large-cap tech with policy tailwinds, avoid meme-stock frenzy, and hedge equity exposure given elevated options activity.  \n\n**Next Update:** Monitor NVDA price action post-Trump comments, VIX for fear spike, and RSS for institutional shifts in real estate/fintech.",

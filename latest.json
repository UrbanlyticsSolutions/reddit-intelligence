The timing of the IPO could change based on market conditions and other factors, and one of the people said it could slip until 2027.\n\n&gt;SpaceX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n&gt;Media reports last week said the rocket-maker is kicking off a secondary share sale that would value it at $800 billion, pitting it against OpenAI for the title of the most valuable private company. However, Musk on Saturday dismissed the reports, calling them inaccurate.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/spacex-pursue-2026-ipo-raising-above-30-billion-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-12-09/",

      "content": "Global Bond Yields Hit 16-Year High on Fading Rate-Cut Bets\n\nGlobal bond markets flashed a warning signal ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Long-dated government bond yields have climbed to levels last seen in 2009, suggesting traders are starting to question whether the era of broad rate-cut cycles is actually ending. A Bloomberg index tracking long-term sovereign yields is now back at 16-year highs. Futures markets reflect that shift: expectations for additional cuts from the European Central Bank have essentially vanished, Japan is seen as almost certain to hike this month, and Australia is now priced for two more quarter-point increases next year. The move comes just as the Fed prepares to announce its next decision. While most investors still expect a cut on Wednesday, the broader message from global markets is that easing may not last as long or run as deep as previously hoped. Anyone else watching this tightening narrative re-emerge? Bond markets usually sniff out trends early, and this feels like a meaningful shift.\n\n\n\nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html)",

The increase is being driven by tougher competition in the credit card business and heavier spending on artificial intelligence across the firm. The drop made JPMorgan the biggest loser in the Dow for the session and marked its worst one-day decline since early April.

(Fundamentals + 10-year durability)\n\n1. They have a near-monopoly on critical technology\nASML is the only company in the world capable of making EUV lithography machines, which are required to produce advanced chips (3nm, 2nm, future nodes).\nThis is the definition of an irreplaceable moat.\nNo EUV machines, no AI chips, no Nvidia, no smartphones, no cars, no defence systems.\nThis is real pricing power.\n\n2. Massive demand for chips for the next decade.\nTrends that structurally depend on ASML:\nAI chips, Cloud computing, Autonomous driving, da centers\nDefence/space, Robotics, Medical devices, Consumer electronics, Solar &amp; battery tech, National chip-sovereignty expansion (US, EU, China, Japan, India)\nEveryone wants to build fabs and every fab needs ASML machines.\n\n3. Backlog is so large they can’t even meet demand\nChip manufacturers wait years for ASML equipment.\nThat’s how strong their order book is.\nHigh backlog = stable revenue visibility = long-term compounding.\n\n4. Margins are exceptional\nGross margins often above 50%\nDominant share of system revenue + services (recurring, high-margin)\n\n5. Governments will never let ASML die: US, EU, Japan, South Korea all depend on them.\nThey're considered a strategic asset for national security.\nGeopolitical risk actually strengthens their position.\n\n6. They raise prices every year\nWhen you’re the only supplier, price elasticity is unlimited.\nMachines cost $150M–$350M+ each — and they sell more every year.\n\n7. 10-year CAGR potential\nRealistic expectations:\nRevenue CAGR 12–18%\nEarnings CAGR 15–22%\nPotential 10-year total return: 3x–6x\nPotential upside if AI demand explodes: 8x–10x\n\nWhat’s your pick and why?",

      "content": "Mastercard (MA) broke into our Top 5 Quality Picks for the first time since August. Here's the breakdown.\n\nWe've been running a scoring algorithm on S&amp;P 500 stocks since August. Basically scores companies on fundamentals and how they stack up against sector peers, then runs them through some validation checks. Only 5 stocks make the cut each month.\n\nMastercard broke in for the first time at #5 on 1st December. The profitability on this thing is genuinely ridiculous. 196.9% return on equity, 45.3% net margins. Scored perfect marks on returns and margin efficiency. Analysts are bullish too: 49 of 62 have it as a Buy, with literally zero Sells, and the consensus implies about 21% upside.\n\nThe problem is valuation. Stockoscope DCF puts intrinsic value around $382  based on 12.9% growth for 5 years, followed by 5 years of tapering growth to 2%, discounted at 8.1% (and it's trading at $537 currently). That's a pretty big premium to pay, even for something this high quality. The growth would have to be around 20% for it to be fairly valued.  \n  \nTechnicals: Currently, it is down 11% from the highs, and there is a nice support  around the 500 levels, which would be around a 16% drop from the top. That would be a better entry than the current level, of course.\n\nCurious where others land on this. The quality is undeniable, but it's a bit pricey. \n\nNot financial advice. DYOR.",

WeRide received L4 driverless city permit in Abu Dhabi, outside of US. They turned their permits and reg approvals into real operating advantage. We can clearly see that WeRide is the first mover and leader in those countries. Working with Grab and Uber to operate their fleets gives them an access to huge target bases. Also, WeRide enters ADAS market, partnered with Bosch gives them more credibility in the auto market. \n\nInstitutional side: recently, ARK Invest purchased 858,295 shares of WeRide and extra 17,326 shares bia ARKQ. BofA, City and BOCI all applied a BUY rating on this stock, showing a long-term confidence in them. Their shareholders include: Fidelity, Greenwoods, Hudson Bay, Invesco, M&amp;G, Mirae Asset, Morgan Stanley IM, Temasek, and NVIDIA.\n\nThis is a super heavy capital industry and not cheap to operate. It's not realistic to expect them to have profits right away. However, when you look closely into their strategy, their partnerships and especially their Q3 performance, you can see the numbers have been improving quarter to quarter. Imo, this company is having a huge potential in the whole auto space in the next few years, they doing the real things instead of saying and doing nothing on press.",

Early commercial routes are expected to include airport-to-city centre connections.\n\nWith the shares at a significant discount to other eVTOL companies such as Archer, Joby and Beta you may want to consider EVTL.",

On the face of it, a 40% downward guidance revision would justify a 40-50% price drop\n* The break down of EPS revision and remediation are indicated below.

I would assume $100B/year. Annual spend is $800B so not substantial.

Basically I’m pretty sure I can afford that much weekly but if I feel financial pressure I will get it down to 200£, but this is in the case but let’s start on 250£.\n\nI have seen many opinions that I should start with SP500 - VUAG, but on the other hand have seen people giving an idea to diversify into world for example or some small % to the gold.\n\nI have two questions; as I’m using trading212, for example if someone mentioned ticker VT is that means on my app/market(UK) VT will be exactly the same like in USA market for example?\n\nAnother question what do you think what strategy on my place would be the best with % allocation and any ideas what to look for?\n\nThank you so much!",

The increase is being driven by tougher competition in the credit card business and heavier spending on artificial intelligence across the firm. The drop made JPMorgan the biggest loser in the Dow for the session and marked its worst one-day decline since early April. Investors seem to be reacting more to the cost outlook than to near-term earnings strength, with margins and future profitability now back in focus.\n\nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-stock-tumbles-over-4-after-company-warns-on-higher-spending-in-2026-195605298.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-stock-tumbles-over-4-after-company-warns-on-higher-spending-in-2026-195605298.html)",

      "content": "Amazon plans to invest $35 billion in India and create 1 million jobs is this good news for AMZN?\n\nAmazon announced it will invest over $35 billion in India and create 1 million jobs by 2030. This represents a significant commitment, clearly signaling a long term dedication to deepening its presence in India.\n\nThis move appears to have dual implications for Amazon:\n\nPositives: India's e-commerce demand continues to grow rapidly. Large scale investment could accelerate Amazon's market share and logistics advantages locally. Long term, it may become a new growth engine.\n\nRisks: The massive investment and long return cycle, coupled with India's intense competition and complex regulations, may not necessarily translate into profits. The short term boost to stock prices could also be limited.\n\nI see this as a classic case of long term upside with short term uncertainty.\n\nDoes this news make you more optimistic about AMZN's long term value? If you're a shareholder, would you increase your position or remain cautious?",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Time Horizon:** Day | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-10 08:02:00 | **Primary Audience:** Retail Traders\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Cautiously Bearish with High Volatility & Retail Skepticism**\nThe sentiment is **conflicted but leans bearish**. Key indicators:\n- **Retail Skepticism is High:** Reddit shows clear fatigue and distrust (\"this market feels fake,\" \"sold everything\"). The focus on GameStop's fundamentals suggests a defensive, contrarian posture by meme-stock traders, not broad bullishness.\n- **Macro Uncertainty Dominates:** The Fed's rate path uncertainty (Reddit #1) and geopolitical risks (Reddit #2) create a ceiling for optimism. The VIX at ~17 is elevated for a calm market, signaling underlying anxiety.\n- **News Flow is Mixed:** Positive corporate news (Palantir contract, Nextdoor surge) is offset by structural concerns (\"Forever Layoffs,\" pension fee disputes). This creates a \"risk-on, risk-off\" intraday environment.\n- **Conclusion:** Institutional flows may be selectively bullish (e.g., on rate-sensitive names), but **retail sentiment is deteriorating**, which can amplify downside moves if institutional support wanes.\n\n---\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES: Across All Sources**\n1.  **Monetary Policy & Macro Uncertainty:** Fed rate cuts (Reddit #1, RSS #7) vs. stubborn yields (10Y at 4.17%). The market is pricing in cuts but wrestling with \"higher for longer\" realities.\n2.  **Geopolitical & Fiscal Risk:** Potential European dumping of U.S. Treasuries (Reddit #2) and Trump-era deal-making (RSS #1) injects volatility into bonds and the dollar.\n3.  **AI & Defense Tech Momentum:** Palantir's major Navy contract (Reddit #5, RSS #6) is a standout, validating the \"AI as a national asset\" theme.\n4.  **Retail Investor Revolt & Meme Stock Resurgence:** GameStop's sustained profitability (Reddit #3, #4, #14) and the Nextdoor surge (RSS #4) show the meme-stock/retail cohort is active and focused on fundamentals this time, not just hype.\n5.  **IPO & Private Market Excitement:** SpaceX's 2026 IPO plans (Reddit #6, #15) are generating significant future-forward speculation.\n6.  **Crypto Existential Crisis vs. Institutional Adoption:** Contrast between a viral \"crypto waste\" post (Reddit #7) and Texas launching a Bitcoin reserve (Reddit #9) shows the sector's bifurcation.\n\n---\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n- **Immediate Catalyst (Today):** Fed Chair Powell's remarks and market reaction to the third rate cut. **Watch for a \"sell the news\" reaction** if guidance is less dovish than hoped.\n- **Strong Positive Signal:** **Palantir (PLTR)** securing a $448M AI defense contract. This is a material, recurring revenue deal that cements its government business. The stock is already up in pre-market (RSS #7).\n- **Contrarian Sentiment Signal:** Extreme retail pessimism (\"sold everything\") is often a short-term contrary indicator. However, it coincides with real economic triggers (\"Forever Layoffs\"), making it a warning, not necessarily a buy signal.\n- **Liquidity Signal:** India opening a $177B pension pool (RSS #2) is a long-term bullish global liquidity factor, but not a day-trade catalyst.\n- **Technical Signal:** **NVDA** showing weakness (-1.46%) while the broader market is mixed. As a leader, its failure to rally on a dovish Fed would be a significant risk-off signal.\n\n---\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n**Primary Risks:**\n1.  **Geopolitical Liquidity Shock:** The threat of foreign selling of U.S. Treasuries (Reddit #2) is a **tail risk** that could spike yields rapidly, crushing growth stocks.\n2.  **Retail Capitulation:** If retail traders continue to exit en masse, it could remove a source of market support for popular names and increase volatility.\n3.  **\"Good News is Bad News\":** Strong economic data could undermine the Fed's dovish stance, reversing the rate-cut rally.\n4.  **Earnings Reality Check:** The \"Forever Layoffs\" trend (Reddit #12) suggests corporate stress that may eventually hit earnings, conflicting with current high valuations.\n\n**Primary Opportunities:**\n1.  **Defense/AI Convergence:** Companies like Palantir bridging AI and national security are in a unique, funded position.\n2.  **Meme Stock Fundamentals:** Stocks like GME that are transitioning to sustained profitability may see a re-rating from both retail and institutional investors.\n3.  **Yield Hunt:** With rates still elevated, high-dividend ETFs (RSS #8) attract capital in a shaky market.\n4.  **IPO Foreshadowing:** The SpaceX news will boost sentiment for private space and defense tech adjacent public companies.\n\n---\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**For Traders/Investors (Day Horizon):**\n\n*   **PLTR: STRONG BUY SIGNAL (Catalyst-Driven).** The Navy contract is a material, high-credibility win. Expect momentum to continue through the day. Entry on any pullback is favored.\n*   **GME: WATCH FOR BREAKOUT.** Positive earnings momentum is being acknowledged by retail. A close above recent resistance on high volume could signal the next leg up. **However, beware of extreme volatility.**\n*   **SECTOR: DEFENSE/AI - OVERWEIGHT.** The Palantir deal signals increased defense tech spending. Look for sympathy moves in peers like RTX, LMT, or AI software companies with government ties.\n*   **SECTOR: TREASURIES - CAUTION.** Avoid long-duration bond ETFs (e.g., TLT) for the day. The geopolitical headline risk (Reddit #2) creates asymmetric downside.\n*   **NVDA: BEARISH LEADERSHIP INDICATOR.** Monitor NVDA closely. If it fails to rally amid a supposedly dovish Fed, it's a signal to reduce risk exposure broadly, especially in tech.\n*   **MARKET: FADE EXTREME GAPS.** The conflicted sentiment suggests choppy action. Avoid chasing large opening gaps (up or down) in major indices; wait for the post-Powell direction to be established.\n*   **CRYPTO: AVOID.** The conflicting narratives (institutional adoption vs. builder exodus) and lack of a clear catalyst suggest sidelining crypto trades today despite Texas news.\n\n**Bottom Line:** The market is at a inflection point post-Fed. **Trade the catalysts (PLTR) but respect the deteriorating retail sentiment and macro risks.** Position sizing should be conservative. The dominant trade of the day is likely long Defense/AI, while the dominant *risk* is a hawkish Fed pivot or geopolitical surprise.",

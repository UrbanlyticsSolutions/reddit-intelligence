      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

      "content": "Musk wins appeal and restores 2018 Tesla pay deal worth $56 billion\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Delaware's Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package from Tesla, which was once valued at $56 billion. Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.”\n\nThe ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThis compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November.\n\nThe ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares.\n\nMusk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock.\n\nIn 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded.\n\nMusk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies.\n\nTesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands.\n\nIn November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales.\n\nTesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan.\n\nThe Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

If you don't know why a stock went up, you won't understand why it goes down...\n\nYou should know when a company is undervalued and when it's overpriced.\n\n**\"I bought a stock one month ago, it went down 5%, should I sell?\"**\n\nIf you truly did your DD and you are a value investor, you just sit it out.

If you are too lazy to read one book, you probably don't have the discipline to be a value investor.\n\nBonus: If this book is to \"difficult\" (no shame in that, I started very very slow) start with Peter Lynch + Youtube New Money.\n\nMost of you have the knowledge but some here either dont understand Valueinvesting or simply dont have the dispcpline and try to chase quick returns.\n\nEverything I do isnt based on my \"opinion\" or community posts its based on the tools of people who 100x smarter than me like Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham etc.\n\nWith these tools I try to find \"gaps\" in the marked and thats it.

Instead of recreating the letters I will simply be linking them:\n\nhttps://theoraclesclassroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1966-Berkshire-AR.pdf\n\nKey Paragraph:\n\n&gt; In addition to the cyclical nature of our business, there are other reasons why a strong financial condition is advisable. As you have been advised previously, the Company has been searching for suitable acquisitions within, and conceivably without, the textile field. Although to date none has been successfully concluded, we continue to have an active interest in such acquisitions. The present state of the money market, in which funds are virtually unobtainable for acquisition purposes, makes it imperative that we have available the liquid assets with which to consummate such acquisitions, should the hoped-for opportunities present themselves. Present uncertainties such as war, tax rates and decreased level of business activity also all combine to emphasize the continuing need for a strong financial condition.\n\nHe is letting the shareholders know he is on the hunt for acquisitions \"within and without, the textile field.\" \n\nI think otherwise this year a big goal of his was soothing shareholders. This is the only time Berkshire Hathaway paid a dividend under his tenure, and there was also a buyback of 37% of its stock. It is celebrating that the numbers now look like the numbers from Berkshire's best years. From here on out excess capital will almost always get re-invested instead of returned to shareholders. It seems like he was throwing them a big bone after his takeover of the company to get them ready for him to take the business in an entirely new direction next year.",

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions. These bonds would likely be best suited in a retirement account due to the federal, state, and local tax implications.",

They have been providing fairly consistent returns. I was content. But, last week the capital gains payout came, which was $1,766, I had it automatically set up to reinvest. But lately, almost all of the profits of the investment in PBLAX have gone in the red.\n\nMy question is, why is it when they had a good enough year for a great payout on investment, did so many of my investments go into the red?",

I don't know if this is old news or if this is something that might be the next sector that is trending other than semiconductors. In my opinion I think the tech side is slowing down and only so much can be innovated when it comes to GPUs, Semis, we are now seeing RAM prices go up with data centers being built. But with data centers being built rumor has it the US power grid can barely keep up with winter (Texas / Illinois specifically) and black outs in summer. \n\nI was eyeing a few energy stocks ($BE, FSLR, GEV, BESF ETF) but I was wondering if these are already priced in? Is energy sector something that is lacking or can money be made in this sector? \n\nI think FSLR will be slower as solar can only do so much. $BE might be the way to go, GEV looks like it has amazing potential and BESF ETF too but I don't have the data on whats comprised in that ETF. (FINVIZ Subscription ran out)\n\n$BE also crashed with the rumor when SPACE X goes public they will put data centers in space, but the argument is space is cold and imo that idea is far fetched just to get Space X in the spot light. \n\nA month ago I was eyeing data center construction stocks but now with the US infrastructure I think energy might be the next trending sector? Thoughts? ",

Maybe you would just like to throw out a neat fact that doesn't warrant a self post? Feel free to post here!\n\n​\n\nIf your question is \"I have $10,000, what do I do?\" or other \"advice for my personal situation\" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:\n\n* How old are you? What country do you live in?\n* Are you employed/making income? How much?\n* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)\n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?\n* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. .\n\nBe aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered investment adviser if you need professional support before making any financial decisions!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORT**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 | **Time Horizon:** Day | **Primary Audience:** Retail Traders\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: CAUTIOUSLY BULLISH WITH ELEVATED RETAIL SPECULATION**\nThe sentiment is bifurcated. Institutional and macro indicators point to a **bullish bias** (rising stocks per Bloomberg, low VIX at 16.87, high options expiry volume). However, retail sentiment (Reddit) reveals **heightened speculative froth and underlying economic anxiety**. The combination creates a \"cautiously bullish\" environment where macro momentum is strong but retail behavior is becoming a contrarian indicator for volatility.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES**\n*   **Macroeconomic Policy & Data Distrust:** A dominant theme. Reddit discussions highlight deep skepticism toward government economic data (\"assumes Zero Housing Inflation\"), Federal Reserve policy (\"stealing from Millennials\"), and the job market (\"can't find a job due to AI\"). This contrasts with the institutional narrative of a resilient bull market.\n*   **Retail Speculation & Meme Stock Revival:** GameStop ($GME) is prominently featured in Reddit's top 15 (3 direct mentions), indicating renewed retail focus on 2021-era meme stocks. This is a clear sentiment signal for heightened risk appetite/naivete among retail traders.\n*   **Global Monetary Policy Divergence:** Japan's 10Y yield crossing 2% is a seismic shift, signaling the end of its ultra-loose monetary era. This could trigger global capital reallocation and yen-related volatility.\n*   **Commodity & Sector-Specific Pressures:** Oil is flagged for continued downside (\"world awash in supply\"). China's rare-earth magnet export decline and New Fortress Energy's delinquent payments point to stress in specific industrial and energy sectors.\n*   **AI as a Double-Edged Sword:** Themes of AI-driven job displacement (Reddit) coexist with major corporate AI deals (Disney-OpenAI), highlighting AI's disruptive economic and investment impact.\n\n### **3. CRITICAL MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Bullish Signal (Institutional):** \"Stocks Climb as Options Expiry Approaches $7.1 Trillion.\" This massive expiry can suppress volatility (pin risk) and drive underlying price action, supporting the near-term bullish trend.\n*   **Bearish/Risk Signal (Macro):** **Japan's 10Y Yield > 2%.** This is the most significant macro signal. It may strengthen the USD, pressure global bond prices, and unsettle leveraged carry trades, potentially leading to unforeseen cross-asset volatility.\n*   **Retail Sentiment Signal (Contrarian):** The concentrated discussion on **$GME** and options trading (\"First options contract\") is a classic sign of late-stage retail frenzy. Historically, such intense focus on highly speculative assets has preceded short-term market corrections or volatility spikes.\n*   **Economic Data Catalyst:** The controversy over November housing inflation data (likely CPI/PCE component) will increase scrutiny on future inflation prints, directly impacting Fed policy expectations.\n\n### **4. RISK & OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT**\n**Primary Risks:**\n1.  **Retail Overextension:** The Reddit data suggests retail traders are diving back into high-risk, high-volatility plays ($GME, options, mining narratives). A sudden sentiment shift could lead to violent unwinds in these pockets, with spillover into broader market sentiment.\n2.  **Global Liquidity Shift:** Rising Japanese yields threaten a key source of global liquidity. A sustained move could tighten financial conditions unexpectedly.\n3.  **Data Credibility Crisis:** Widespread distrust of economic data (a theme on Reddit) can amplify market reactions to surprises, increasing headline risk.\n4.  **Sector-Specific Defaults:** Stories like New Fortress Energy's payment issues signal credit stress in higher-risk corporate debt segments.\n\n**Primary Opportunities:**\n1.  **Following Institutional Flow:** The bullish institutional tone (Bloomberg) and large options expiry suggest continued momentum in large-cap, index-driving names.\n2.  **Volatility Suppression Play:** The low VIX combined with a massive options expiry creates conditions for selling volatility (e.g., via covered calls, iron condors) in the very short term.\n3.  **Beneficiaries of a \"Non-Tech\" Bull Market:** The news article \"Why This Bull Market Isn't All About Tech\" hints at potential rotation into cyclical or value sectors, which may be under-owned by the retail cohort.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**WATCHLIST & ACTIONS:**\n\n*   **SECTOR: Energy (Avoid/Short Bias)** - The fundamental outlook for oil is bearish (\"world awash in supply\"). Avoid long positions in oil majors and services. Consider **$SCO** or energy sector shorts (**$XLE** puts) as a hedge.\n*   **$GME / $AMC / Meme Basket: Extreme Caution** - Retail focus is a contrarian indicator. These are liquidity-dependent sentiment plays. **Watch for a surge in volume without price advancement** as a sign of distribution and an impending reversal.\n*   **$NVDA / Mega-Cap Tech: Momentum with a Hedge** - **$NVDA** showing strength (+3.93%). The trend is your friend, but protect gains. **Use trailing stops or consider hedging a tech portfolio with a broad market put option** ahead of potential retail-driven volatility.\n*   **CURRENCY: JPY Pairs** - **Watch USD/JPY and EUR/JPY for increased volatility.** The break in JGB yields could lead to a sharp, trending move. This is primarily a forex/futures play.\n*   **MACRO: U.S. Financials ($XLF)** - Rising global yields (US 10Y at 4.12%, Japan >2%) can improve net interest margin outlook for banks. This sector may benefit from rotation and is less tied to retail meme dynamics.\n*   **ACTION: Review Portfolio Gamma Exposure** - With $7.1T in options expiring, understand how your positions (especially short options) are affected by \"pin\" risk and gamma squeezes. De-risk concentrated option positions.\n\n---\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market is being pulled in two directions. Institutional and macro-technical factors support a continued grind higher, particularly in large caps. However, the resurgence of extreme retail speculation and a pivotal shift in Japanese monetary policy are flashing yellow lights. **Tactical Approach:** Favor quality and sectors benefiting from higher yields, but reduce exposure to the most speculative retail favorites. Prepare for a potential increase in volatility after the large options expiry passes.",

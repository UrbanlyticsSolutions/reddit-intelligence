      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

      "content": "r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Fundamentals Friday Dec 19, 2025\n\nThis is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Friday.",

      "content": "Trump Media Technology Group shares surged 40% today. ​​It seems the blonde guy is back to playing the stock market again.\n\nTrump Media &amp; Technology Group surged a staggering 40% today, with the intraday rally clearly not the work of “normal capital.” Honestly, seeing this move, my first thought wasn't fundamentals it was whether that blond guy was back in the game personally “stoking the fire.”\n\nA single word from him can instantly make the stock price defy gravity. The question is: Is this 40% surge the start of a new rally, or are old players looking for buyers at these high levels?\n\nI'm a bit conflicted myself:\n\nOn one hand, you can never underestimate the “madness” of this stock using traditional logic;\n\nOn the other hand, chasing it at these levels easily turns you into the “last one holding the bag.”\n\nSo I'd love to hear your thoughts\n\nDo you see any worthwhile opportunities here?\n\nIs this a short term bet, an event driven play, or have you completely written off stocks like this?",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

But Google's TPU performance shows that big techs can rely on their own custom chips rather than buying from Nvidia or AMD.  Therefore, I am guessing big techs will use more and more of their own custom chips in future. Considering those facts, would it be a good idea to buy Broadcom by selling all of AMD's shares? ",

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions. These bonds would likely be best suited in a retirement account due to the federal, state, and local tax implications.",

      "content": "are there any power ETF's that only hold Texas based power production companies?\n\nIs there an ETF that holds only Texas power production companies and companies who produce power for sale in Texas?  I mean the companies that produce the power, not the companies that buy it and sell it to consumers. \n\nFrom where I sit, Texas is the number one destination for these huge power hungry AI data centers.  There are by my calculations exactly 0 new power plants being built, for the most part the power companies are focusing on making them more efficient or expanding some but shovels breaking ground on new is zero and its been zero since Biden passed the build back act.  \n\nIn my opinion there is a pretty clear reasons why none have gotten off the ground, they have long build times and there are countless ways that they can be derailed.  \n\nThe reason for Texas is that they have a unique power grid that allows for open market bidding on power and its not meaningfully connected to the eastern or western part of the US grid.    \n\nIf my thesis is correct that data centers will require a huge amount of power, can be put up very quickly, have vast resources to bid on the open market and no new power sources are coming online for at least 10 years, the premium that the producers of power in Texas will be able to charge is going to go up significantly.

On that same day, 8 executives/directors executed stock sales under 10b5-1 plans. I understand the same-day execution is plausibly explained by price-based triggers or limit orders.\n\nHowever, I saw that the 8 plans that executed on December 8 were initiated in two clusters:\n\n* 3 plans on March 13, 2025\n* 5 plans on August 6, 2025\n\nI pulled Form 4 data for Wave from 2024–2025 to look closer at this pattern and wrote up the details here [https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/](https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/)\n\nMy question:  \nI'm relatively new to this. Is this kind of clustered 10b5-1 adoption and execution fairly typical in biotech or other industries? Is this easily explained by compensation cycles/normal planning, or is this something you’d flag as worth a second look? \n\nI haven't yet benchmarked against a larger sample of biotech companies, that's on my list if this is indeed notable.",

Now I find myself in a position where a large percentage of my portfolio is in this single security and I'm looking to diversify.\n\nI have been told that enhanced direct indexing is a good option for unwinding a concentrated position. I'm a novice here but if I understand it correctly, for a non-trivial fee, a management firm will use my concentrated position as leverage to buy long and short positions and use tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains, effectively diversifying while deferring the large taxable event.\n\nAre there big inherent risks I'm not aware of? Are there other options I should consider? I recognize there's a real risk by having nearly half of my portfolio in a single security but I don't want to make a mistake and take an even greater risk trying to unwind it. \n\nThanks!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Time Horizon:** Day | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 10:31:56\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Bearish with Elevated Anxiety**\n- **Overall Sentiment:** **Bearish.** A confluence of macro pressures, retail skepticism, and institutional caution dominates.\n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Highly defensive and cynical. Top themes include distrust of economic data (\"Zero housing inflation\" seen as manipulation), warnings of a record \"Witching Day\" (quadruple witching options expiration), and anxiety over national debt and interest costs. The mention of \"Extreme media fud warning\" and calls to \"wait for the fat pitch\" indicate a retail base that is sidelined or expecting a downturn.\n- **Macro & Institutional Backdrop:** Reinforces caution. The VIX at 16.87 is elevated but not panicked, suggesting persistent uncertainty. The 10Y Treasury Yield at 4.16% and the Bank of Japan's historic rate hike are tightening global financial conditions, pressuring risk assets. The US Equity Risk Premium of 4.33% is attractive but may not be enough to offset near-term volatility fears.\n\n---\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES: Across All Sources**\n1.  **Global Monetary Policy Shift & Debt Anxiety:** The **Bank of Japan's rate hike to a 30-year high** and Japan's 10Y yield crossing 2% are seismic shifts, pulling liquidity from global markets. This is compounded by intense focus on the **$38 trillion US debt** and its >$1 trillion annual interest burden (Reddit, Macro Data).\n2.  **Distrust in Economic Data & Institutions:** A major theme on Reddit is skepticism toward official data, specifically the \"surprising November drop\" in housing inflation being labeled \"wacky.\" This erodes confidence in the Fed's policy pathway and market stability.\n3.  **Sector-Specific Stress & Volatility Events:**\n    *   **Tech Underperformance:** Criticism of Apple's capital allocation ($750B in buybacks) and a 35-year low in US gaming hardware sales point to consumer tech exhaustion.\n    *   **Energy Sector Divergence:** While Saudi oil supply is rising (RSS News), Citadel's low gains are attributed to falling gas profits, suggesting volatility and potential oversupply in energy markets.\n    *   **Options-Driven Volatility Risk:** The highlight of a record **\"FRIDAY SET FOR RECORD 'WITCHING DAY'\"** signals expectations for significant market moves due to the mass expiration of options and futures.\n4.  **Retail Speculation & Meme Stock Echoes:** Mentions of **GME at $406 on Google** (likely a data error or outdated price) and a crypto mining windfall story show lingering speculative impulses, but these are outliers against a broadly risk-off social sentiment.\n\n---\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS AND CATALYSTS**\n- **Immediate Catalyst (Today):** **Quadruple Witching Expiration.** The unprecedented volume of contracts expiring could amplify price swings and liquidity distortions, especially in heavily shorted or meme-adjacent names.\n- **Macro Catalyst:** **Bank of Japan Policy Shift.** This is a structural change ending the era of ultra-cheap Japanese capital (the \"yen carry trade\"), which has funded global investments for decades. This strengthens the USD and increases borrowing costs worldwide.\n- **Contrarian Signal:** The **\"Big Surprise From Small Companies\"** headline (RSS) hints at potential resilience in small-caps, which could be an early reversal signal if the broader market stabilizes.\n- **Sentiment Signal:** Extreme retail distrust of data and media (\"FUD warning\") is often a contrarian indicator, but paired with concrete macro tightening, it currently reinforces the bearish narrative.\n\n---\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n- **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Liquidity Shock:** The BoJ hike, combined with high US yields, risks a sudden withdrawal of global market liquidity.\n    2.  **Volatility Spike:** Quadruple witching could trigger outsized moves, and a VIX break above 20 would likely accelerate selling.\n    3.  **Earnings Risk:** Sector news (weak gaming hardware, Apple criticism) suggests the upcoming Q4 earnings season may reveal broader consumer weakness.\n    4.  **Credit Stress:** Rising risk-free rates (10Y at 4.16%) pressure corporate margins and debt refinancing, a risk highlighted by the Sixth Street private credit outlook (RSS).\n\n- **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Flight to Quality:** High Equity Risk Premium (4.33%) makes select, profitable large-cats attractive for long-term entry.\n    2.  **Volatility Premium:** Elevated VIX and event risk (witching) favor option sellers with strict risk management.\n    3.  **Sector Rotation:** Evidence of a \"broad network overhaul\" bearing fruit at **FedEx** (RSS) could signal opportunities in industrials and logistics if the economy avoids a hard landing.\n\n---\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**WATCH:**\n- **VIX:** A sustained move above 18.50 signals escalating fear and likely broader market decline.\n- **USD/JPY:** The currency pair will be highly sensitive to BoJ policy fallout; strength in USD pressures multinational earnings.\n- **Small-Cap Index (IWM):** Monitor for divergence vs. large-caps (SPY) following the \"big surprise\" headline for early risk-on signals.\n\n**ACT:**\n- **SECTOR: Financials (XLF) - CAUTION.** Beneficiaries of higher rates but at risk from Treasury volatility and the flattening yield curve. Watch for stress in regional banks.\n- **SECTOR: Energy (XLE) - NEUTRAL/AVOID.** Conflicting signals (rising Saudi supply, weak gas profits). Lack of clear trend suggests sidelining until inventory data clarifies.\n- **FDX: MONITOR FOR STRENGTH.** FedEx's operational turnaround (RSS) is a key microeconomic read-through. A hold above key support could indicate industrial resilience.\n- **SYMBOL: SOXS - UNDERSTAND THE SIGNAL.** The Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X ETF is down -8.94% pre-market. This *could* indicate a sharp, short-covering rally in semis (bullish for tech), but it is an extremely high-risk instrument that reflects intraday volatility, not a fundamental bet.\n- **ACTION: REDUCE LEVERAGE, RAISE CASH.** The combination of macro headwinds, a major volatility event, and negative retail sentiment advises defensive positioning. Use any witching-related strength to de-risk.\n- **ACTION: DELAY NEW LONG ENTRIES.** The mantra \"wait for the fat pitch\" (Reddit) is apt. Let the witching volatility and BoJ reaction settle before committing new capital.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market faces a tactical volatility event (quadruple witching) within a deteriorating strategic backdrop (global liquidity withdrawal, debt concerns). Sentiment is defensive. **Priority is capital preservation.** Adopt a wait-and-see approach, using the day's volatility to assess true underlying strength, not to chase moves.",

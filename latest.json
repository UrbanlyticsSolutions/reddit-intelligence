      "content": "Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting has just concluded, leaving the market with several intriguing signals.\n\nToday, Microsoft shareholders formally approved all company proposals, including board elections and the 2026 stock plan.\n\nBut more notably shareholders rejected all six shareholder proposals, including one demanding Microsoft submit a “human rights due diligence report.”\n\nThis raises several questions:\n\nAmid AI's sweeping expansion, Microsoft increasingly resembles a “state-owned enterprise among tech giants.” Yet shareholders have clearly granted the company greater autonomy this time.\n\nFrom a purely market perspective, this outcome is almost entirely positive for the stock price, as the company avoids being shackled by additional regulatory reporting requirements.\n\nYet from a long-term ESG and social responsibility perspective, won't this become a latent concern for Microsoft? Especially as tensions escalate around sensitive areas like OpenAI, AI regulation, and data ethics.\n\nMy personal take: This vote feels more like the market collectively saying, “Keep driving performance we don't want distractions.”\n\nBut as AI operations expand, whether such proposals resurface remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs this a rational market choice, or is it merely deferring potential long-term risks?\n\nI'm particularly curious to hear others' perspectives on Microsoft's positioning under AI regulatory pressure over the next 1–3 years.",

But amid weakness in the crypto market of late, its shares have been in a free fall. And that's putting it lightly. In just the past six months, the stock has lost more than half of its value.\n\nHeading into trading on Wednesday, the stock was down 60% from its 52-week high of $457.22, which it reached back in July. Is the sell-off in Strategy's stock overdone, and could this be a good time to invest in the tech company, or could there be more trouble ahead?",

Since PCE is the Fed’s preferred gauge, this print will likely factor into next week’s meeting, where markets already expect another rate cut. Personal income rose 0.4% for the month, while spending increased 0.3%, a bit softer than forecast but still pointing to steady consumer activity. Overall, nothing shocking in the data just more signs that inflation is cooling, but not fast enough to fully remove uncertainty around policy.\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/pce-inflation-report-september-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/pce-inflation-report-september-2025.html)",

      "content": "Berkshire is on track to lag behind the S&amp;P 500 in Buffett's last year as CEO\n\nBerkshire Hathaway had a pretty interesting run this year, especially around the time Warren Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of the year. Before that surprise in early May, BRK.B was actually beating the S&amp;P 500 by a wide margin outperformance of over 22 percentage points in 2025.\nThat changed quickly after the announcement. Over the next three months, the stock slid nearly 15% to a low around $459 in early August. Since then, it’s bounced back about 10% and now sits near $504, putting it up roughly 11% for the year.\nThe problem is the broader market hasn’t slowed down. The S&amp;P 500 is up almost 38% since its April low and nearly 17% year-to-date, closing just a few points below its all-time high. Even with Berkshire’s rebound, it hasn’t been able to catch up with that pace. Feels like a year where the market is rewarding risk and momentum more than steady, conservative names. Curious how others see Berkshire here long-term hold as usual, or starting to fall behind in this kind of market?\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/06/berkshire-hathaway-is-on-track-to-lag-behind-the-sp-500-in-buffetts-last-year-as-ceo.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "content": "Google - not AMD - is Nvidia’s greatest threat because of their full-stack AI and AlphaEvolve\n\nAMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else, but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company’s conception. Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000: \n\n\"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we had the ultimate search engine, it would understand everything on the web; it would understand, um, you know, exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. And that's obviously artificial intelligence.\"[ Google Co-Founder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI (2000)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OT_Uj2z3Z0) \\- For those that don’t know, it was supposedly Larry Page’s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI.\n\n# Full-stack AI\n\nNow, imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation. Your first thought will probably be: Which should I pick? ChatGPT immediately comes to mind, but you want to do your research properly. Through your research, you find that Google's Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck, at least among American AI models. Plus, they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model. Perfect. Google seems like a good choice. Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity (especially if they improve).\n\nBut what about implementation? Google offers enterprise-ready API:s via Vertex with more features coming like auth, database and payments, Google Cloud for storage, and now even at location TPU:s that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible. Super. Suddenly, your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google, and along the way, you never touch an Nvidia product.\n\nBut before you make your final decision, you ask yourself: Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term, so I don’t get vendor-locked with an inferior offering?\n\nI’ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never want to bet against the man - and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way. I don’t imagine Nvidia is particularly - or really at all - threatened by Google in the short term, though Google's TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices, reducing profit margin. Apparently, OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it, according to[ Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1994468652716859394), worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia. Though what is actually important is not the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future.\n\n# AlphaEvolve\n\nI allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed[ AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/). The evolutionary AI system had, in secret, improved everything from the training of their AI models to Google's hardware, i.e., their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multi-billion dollar deal for them, with Meta considering the same. \n\nThe remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro, not even Gemini 2.5. Today, it’s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations, and in the future, it will use far more powerful models than that. Meaning that the better Google’s AI models get, the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google’s models and hardware. The cheaper and better Google’s hardware, the more powerful models can be built and run. The more powerful the models, the better the hardware. And so on.\n\nBetter AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia’s CUDA moat. One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code, causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA. But once AI models become sufficiently advanced, the programming difficulty may not be a concern, or Google and Gemini create some CUDA-variant of their own. Rumors also exist of them doing just that.\n\n# All in all\n\nThis means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business, it’s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia. If they do it often enough, AI labs will eventually wonder: can you build better AI models without Nvidia? This will be especially true if other AI-labs do it too:[ “resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs”](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/tpuv7-google-takes-a-swing-at-the).\n\nDoes this mean I think Nvidia is done for? Not at all, as I said, I've spent enough time studying Jensen that I'd never want to bet against him. After all, he is a man who roommated with a 17-year-old ex-con covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5-trillion-dollar man. Jensen has a ton of cards to play, and he’s already playing them perfectly.\n\nNvidia still has a hardware/hardware-software lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future. If they make a substantial compute leap, Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia’s AI lab, absorb one of the AI labs, or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race. He is securing long-term deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia. Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development. He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem. Nvidia will likely begin to offer full-stack solutions of its own. And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia, Google and AMD.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I hold a significant long position in Google (Alphabet). The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not constitute financial or investment advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.  \n  \n**TLDR;** Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term, though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin. But over the long term, Google’s full stack offerings - AI models/applications, cloud and TPUs - with AI model’s designed to improve AI models and hardware (AlphaEvolve) getting better, Google might even take a long term lead. Though, Jensen is playing Nvidia’s cards perfectly. ",

      "content": "SpaceX aims for $800 billion valuation in secondary share sale, WSJ reports\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, SpaceX is looking at a secondary share sale that could value the company as high as $800 billion. The report also mentions that an IPO could happen as soon as late 2026, though nothing is confirmed yet. Elon Musk has said before that he’s open to taking SpaceX public at some point, even though he’s also talked about the downsides of being a public company. For now, this secondary sale would mainly allow existing investors and employees to sell some shares while the company remains private. If this valuation holds, it would officially put SpaceX among the most valuable companies in the world without ever needing to ring the IPO bell (at least for now). Curious what people think: does SpaceX actually benefit from going public, or is staying private still the better move for a company like this?\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/spacex-aims-for-800b-valuation-in-secondary-share-sale-wsj-reports.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/spacex-aims-for-800b-valuation-in-secondary-share-sale-wsj-reports.html)",

I run DCF models on everything I buy. Spend probably an hour per company. But then I see other people post their intrinsic value estimates for the same stock and we're like 30% apart. Same company, wildly different conclusions.\n\nThe inputs matter so much more than the model. What growth rate? What discount rate? Terminal value? Change any slightly and your output swings massively.\n\nStarted using multiple methods and only getting interested when they converge. If DCF says one thing but Graham number says another I get skeptical. Been cross referencing my spreadsheets with valuesense lately just to sanity check myself.\n\nHow do you guys deal with this uncertainty?

The other 2 RAM companies, Samsung an SK Hyinx will also profit as a whole 1/3rd of their competition in the consumer RAM market disappears completely. The AI Bubble popping would be because AI companies can’t meet expectations, thus not making profits, causing the bubble to pop, or the market crash. But these RAM providers ARE meeting expectations by selling the hardware. If the crash occurs, how would their stocks drop, if they are making profits by selling hardware?\n\nNote: I’m a fairly new investor, so I may be way off the mark with this evaluation.

      "content": "Puts vs. inverse ETFs? A one year update on MSTR\n\nA year ago on Saturday, December 7, 2024, [I joined the chorus of skeptics in calling bullshit on MSTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h8me2c/best_way_to_establish_a_short_position_on_mstr/), which had closed the previous Friday (December 6, 2024) at 395.01. As I was 100% convinced it would go down, I wanted to figure how to establish a bearish position. Unfortunately, as a long-only investor, I had no experience in doing this, so I thought asked this subreddit how best to achieve this exposure.\n\n* Most of the posters called me crazy.\n* Some agreed with my thesis but advised me not to pursue this: they were right.\n* Some thought MSTR would continue to moon.\n* Some suggested inverse ETFs.\n* Some suggested puts.\n\nUltimately, I decided to sit this out. However, so that I could be prepared the next time an opportunity presented itself, I decided to follow the outcomes of various strategies I would have considered.\n\nAs you probably know, being bearish on a stock not only requires that you are directionally correct, but that you are on point with the timing as well because you otherwise get gaped by exorbitant interest (with shorts), volatility decay (with inverse ETFs), or theta decay (with options). To make sure I didn't cherry pick the perfect time points, I chose **exactly one year** (12/7/24 to 12/6/25) for each of these securities. For the put options, I chose one- and two-year January dated expirations with round numbers (all initial prices adjusted for reverse splits). Note that the specific options denoted in asterisk have extremely low volumes:\n\n|Ticker|Strategy|Position|Initial|Current|% Change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[MSTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR/)|Underlying Stock|Long|395.01|178.99|(-54.69%)|\n|[MSTZ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTZ/)|2x Inverse ETF|Short|19.06|13.02|(-31.69%)|\n|[SMST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SMST/)|2x Inverse ETF|Short|113.00|71.24|(-36.96%)|\n|[MSTR260116P00300000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR260116P00300000/)|Jan 2026 300p|Short|104.02|121.27|\\+16.58%|\n|[MSTR260116P00250000\\*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR260116P00250000/)|Jan 2026 250p|Short|74.30|72.81|(-2.01%)|\n|[MSTR260116P00200000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR260116P00200000/)|Jan 2026 200p|Short|49.65|30.71|(-38.15%)|\n|[MSTR270115P00300000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR270115P00300000/)|Jan 2027 300p|Short|132.00|144.05|\\+9.13%|\n|[MSTR270115P00250000\\*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR270115P00250000/)|Jan 2027 250p|Short|98.80|100.00|\\+1.21%|\n|[MSTR270115P00200000\\*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR270115P00200000/)|Jan 2027 200p|Short|69.09|67.20|(-2.74%)|\n\nAs you can see, I was **spectacularly right** that the price of MSTR would plummet. MSTR bagholders have had a miserable time (-55%). However, I would have also lost about 1/3 of my principle with inverse ETFs MSTZ or SMST, as they naturally \"sell low\" and \"buy high\" (the basis of their volatility decay).\n\nNote that even though MSTR has fallen below the strike price for all the options, the less initially OTM put options (300p) would have been positive whereas the 200p would have been in the red.\n\n**\"Why don't you short it?\"**\n\nIn the end, it pretty much never makes sense to short a stock, even one that is completely garbage. You get an average of 11% per year with much less risk just for indexing (which requires no conviction), &gt;20% in recent years. If you really have the ability to generate alpha--as one must suppose to justify a short position--you can presumably get much higher than &gt;20% annual returns.",

Story: EV growth stalled, and aggregive competitiion in China from domestic players. Screens are doing really well and actively buying back shares. Margin expansive in latest quarter. \n\n**LRN (Stride, Inc.)**\n\n Riskier play due to litigation risk for fraud/fudging enrollment lawsuite. Institutional investors probably wont touch it until law suit is settled. Other issue is the failed IT migration which caused loss of \\~10k student enrolment.

It looks at Russia selling cut-rate oil to India, India using that discount to hedge its future, and the United States trying to keep its weight in the system through sanctions and trade pressure. You see the outlines of a world where energy isn’t just fuel but a way of shaping how states move, who they rely on, and how far their autonomy can stretch.\n\nCurious what you think: are we watching the early shape of new alliances forming, or is this just another cycle in a system that ultimately bends back toward U.S. influence?",

Is it worth to put any amount in such accounts, or is it better off to go all in on ETFs, stocks and other commodities?\n\n*If yes, how much is a good amount?\n\nI’ve been thinking about this as the compounding is higher than my local banks, but to receive a hefty return implies significant amount I have to pump in as well.

I’m 19 years old and my plan is to keep adding to my ETFs and hold them long-term for 30+ years.\n\nRight now I have VOO and QQQM. Some people have suggested adding SCHD, but others say SCHD is more suited for people who are closer to retirement because of its dividend focus. I’m not quite sure what the best move is, so I’m just wondering what everyone else thinks or recommends. And if we’re to add what the ideal break down would be for each ETF.😄🙏",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-06 07:32:11 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral-to-Bearish with Retail Distress**\nThe sentiment is mixed but tilting negative. **Reddit sentiment is distinctly bearish**, dominated by job loss headlines (Tyson, US job cuts surging 183%), retail trading losses (\"-75k over 5 years\"), and skepticism toward market events (CVNA S&P addition mocked). This reflects a pessimistic, frustrated retail base. However, **fundamental data shows resilience**: core inflation (2.8%) is lower than expected, a positive for the Fed, and the VIX at 15.78 suggests moderate, not panicked, volatility. The divergence between grim social sentiment and steady macro indicators creates a **neutral overall bias with high caution**.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES\n*   **Labor Market Deterioration:** The most dominant theme. Reddit highlights massive job cuts (Tyson, record October layoffs), contrasting with a stable official Unemployment Rate (4.4%). This suggests the pain is concentrated in specific sectors/companies, not yet fully captured in aggregates.\n*   **Inflation & Fed Policy:** The delayed September core CPI print of 2.8% is a key positive data point, indicating disinflation progress. This is a critical theme for market direction.\n*   **Retail Speculation & Meme Stock Activity:** Continued focus on **GameStop (GME)** (price updates, social media praise) and derision toward **CVNA's** S&P 500 addition. This indicates a persistent, though possibly fatigued, meme stock undercurrent.\n*   **Sector & Single-Stock Volatility:** News highlights extreme moves (Teva crushing earnings, AST SpaceMobile dropping 30%, a stock up 96% joining S&P). The FMP snapshot shows huge daily swings in low-volume names like IRBT (+21.98%) and PAVS (+16.19%).\n*   **Valuation & Capital Events:** **SpaceX's potential $800B valuation** and a major **ICICI Prudential AMC IPO ($1.2B)** signal ongoing large-scale capital formation, contrasting with retail's negative cash flow narratives.\n\n## 3. IMPORTANT MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n*   **Bullish Catalyst:** **Core CPI at 2.8%.** This is below expectations and supports the narrative that the Fed has room to ease policy, a fundamental positive for equity valuations.\n*   **Bearish Catalyst:** **Surge in Announced Job Cuts.** The 183% jump in October job cuts per Reddit, if accurate and leading, signals corporate caution and potential consumer weakness ahead.\n*   **Technical Signal:** **VIX at 15.78.** This is elevated from recent lows but not spiking, suggesting options markets are pricing in uncertainty, not outright fear. **Gold (GLD $386.44)** is steady, not rallying aggressively, indicating no flight to safety yet.\n*   **Sentiment Signal:** **Extreme Retail Pessimism.** The tone on Reddit is a contrarian indicator. When retail capitulates (\"I'm done\"), it can sometimes mark a sentiment low, but it also reflects a lack of buying power from this cohort.\n\n## 4. PRIMARY RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES\n*   **Risks:**\n    1.  **Earnings & Jobs Disconnect Risk:** The risk that widespread job cuts (a leading indicator) eventually hit consumption and corporate earnings, making current equity valuations look extended.\n    2.  **Retail Liquidation Risk:** Continued retail trader losses may lead to further capitulation selling in speculative pockets of the market (meme stocks, low-float names).\n    3.  **Single-Stock Volatility Risk:** The huge daily moves in stocks like IRBT, PAVS, WBD indicate a market prone to sharp, news-driven re-pricing, increasing portfolio risk.\n*   **Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Policy Pivot Opportunity:** Softer inflation data builds the case for a more dovish Fed in 2026, which would benefit rate-sensitive sectors (Technology, Growth).\n    2.  **Contrarian Sentiment Opportunity:** The palpable retail despair could set up for a tradable bounce if macro data (like CPI) continues to improve.\n    3.  **Sector Rotation Opportunity:** Strength in Healthcare (per news) and Utilities (Constellation, Vistra in news) may indicate a defensive rotation, offering relative safety.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n*   **SECTOR: INDUSTRIALS & CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY - CAUTION.** Monitor for follow-through on the job cut headlines, especially in manufacturing and retail-adjacent sectors. The \"manufacturing jobs\" Reddit story suggests a coming skills gap, but near-term pain is evident.\n*   **SECTOR: HEALTHCARE - WATCH FOR STRENGTH.** News explicitly highlights a \"surging\" sector. Teva's strong earnings vs. Pfizer's struggle shows stock-picking is key. This sector offers defensive characteristics amid economic uncertainty.\n*   **SYMBOL: CVNA - HIGH RISK / SENTIMENT DRIVEN.** Its addition to the S&P 500 is being met with retail mockery and disbelief. This creates high volatility risk—both from potential institutional buying (index funds) and retail short-selling/skepticism.\n*   **SYMBOL: GME - SENTIMENT BAROMETER.** Its price action and social media mentions serve as a real-time gauge of speculative retail risk appetite. Stability here may indicate calm; a large move will ripple through other meme stocks.\n*   **MACRO TRADE: MONITOR 10Y YIELD (4.11%).** The lower-than-expected core CPI is a catalyst for lower yields. A sustained break below 4.10% could trigger a broad market rally, particularly in growth stocks. **Watch NVDA** (slightly down today) as a key sensitivity indicator to this yield move.\n*   **ACTION: REDUCE LOW-QUALITY SPECULATION.** The environment of single-stock explosions (IRBT, PAVS) alongside retail trader losses is a warning. Favor quality, liquidity, and fundamentals over low-float momentum plays in the near term.\n\n**CONCLUSION:** The market is at a crossroads between improving inflation data and deteriorating labor market anecdotes. **The prudent stance is cautious neutrality.** Prioritize risk management, favor large-cap and defensive sectors, and use the 10-year Treasury yield as a key guide for market direction. Ignore the speculative noise in low-volume movers; the real signal will come from the macro data flow and institutional response to the CPI trend.",

      "content": "Musk wins appeal and restores 2018 Tesla pay deal worth $56 billion\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Delaware's Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package from Tesla, which was once valued at $56 billion. Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.”\n\nThe ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThis compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November.\n\nThe ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares.\n\nMusk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock.\n\nIn 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded.\n\nMusk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies.\n\nTesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands.\n\nIn November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales.\n\nTesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan.\n\nThe Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.",

      "content": "Altseason Is Canceled. Forever.\n\nIt’s end of 2025, and “altseason” has quietly been pushed from 2024 to 2025 to now maybe 2026. What’s changed isn’t timing, it’s belief. Fewer people actually think it’s coming anymore.\n\nThe uncomfortable reality is that altcoins used to rally on new buyers. That buyer base is basically gone. Crypto Twitter, maybe \\~50k people, already owns altcoins. These are cycle veterans, already exposed, already burned, already allocated. There’s no fresh capital here to move markets.\n\nRetail is fragmented and underfunded. The only entities that can actually move prices are funds, institutions, and wealthy allocators. They draw the chart. And they are not buying altcoins.\n\nWhy? Because most altcoins don’t represent ownership.\n\nGovernance tokens especially have been exposed over the past year. On paper, token holders vote. In practice, turnout is tiny, execution is optional, and core teams or foundations retain override powers under “security” or “urgency.” When votes conflict with insider preferences, outcomes get delayed, reframed, or bypassed. Over time, rational holders stop participating. Governance turns into theater.\n\nSky(MakerDao) is a good example. Votes happened. Debates happened. And yet major decisions were effectively decided elsewhere. Participation collapsed once it became clear votes didn’t constrain outcomes.\n\nEven if governance worked perfectly, it still wouldn’t solve the core issue: institutions don’t buy voting rights. They buy ownership.\n\nThis leads to the deeper structural flaw: the DAO vs devco split. Tokens live in DAOs. Teams, IP, trademarks, and execution live in labs companies. When acquisitions happen, buyers acquire the devco, not the DAO. The token isn’t bought. Holders don’t benefit. We’ve seen this repeatedly with Tensor, Padre, Axelar, and others.\n\nThe people and IP move on. The token is left governing an empty shell.\n\nThis problem even applies to Ethereum. ETH is a utility token, not ownership. It doesn’t guarantee cash flows, equity, or control. Its valuation depends on demand and relevance, not rights. And relevance is fragile in a world of L2s, fee compression, and improving tech.\n\nInstitutions aren’t avoiding altcoins because they “don’t get crypto.” They’re avoiding them because there’s nothing to own.\n\nUntil tokens represent real ownership, enforceable rights, or cash flows, altcoin season probably stays a meme. Fixing that likely means regulation, securities, and a very different crypto culture.\n\nAnd that’s the real tradeoff no one wants to talk about.",

      "title": "If inflation is only 2.7%, why am I paying so much more for meat and coffee?",
      "content": "If inflation is only 2.7%, why am I paying so much more for meat and coffee?\n\nThe latest [**CPI report**](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf) has been confusing to some because a 2.7% increase seems absurdly low for some goods. But this figure is only the *weighted* increase across a very wide range of goods, and the variation in increase can be quite high.\n\nFortunately, the report also includes annual inflation rates for a huge range of goods, starting from [**Table 1**](https://imgur.com/a/8ePyoG5) (broad categories) and [**Table 2**](https://imgur.com/a/G1ok61W) (detailed categories). And from November 2024 to November 2025, some goods certainly *have* skyrocketed in price, including but not limited to:\n\n* Beef and veal are up over 15%, with roasts being up over 20%!\n\n* Frozen fish are up almost 12%\n\n* Instant coffee is up 25%\n\n* Fuel oil is up 11%\n\n* Audio equipment is up 10%\n\n**This means that lots of consumers whose shopping preferences involve a lot of the more-inflated goods will indeed be paying a lot more.****\n\nTwo other crucial things to keep in mind:\n\n1. The annualized inflation rate above (2.7%) is a comparison from *November* 2024 to November 2025. But what you remember is probably 2024's prices *overall*, which were lower on average than in November 2025!\n\n2. The BLS uses *seasonal adjustment* to generally mitigate the influence of seasonal abundance or deficit, sales, etc. This is necessary to fairly compare prices across months and avoid \"silly\" results where it looks like prices have skyrocketed but it's just a fruit's off-season. But what you remember is the actual prices you paid at the counter, which *are* affected by seasonal factors.\n\nThe best way to check out the price change of an individual good is to use [**the BLS data finder**](https://data.bls.gov/dataQuery/find?fq=survey:%5Bcu%5D&amp;s=popularity:D). It will show you the calculated index for various things, which is basically the technical measure they use for prices.\n\nFor example, say I feel like steaks have gone up a crazy amount in the last 2 years. [**I can find the non-seasonally-adjusted dataset for beef steaks**](https://data.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CUUR0000SEFC03) and compare the January 2024 index (281.658) to the November 2025 index (332.599). That's an 18% increase in terms of what I might actually *feel* prices went up by since 2024, almost 4% higher than the seasonally adjusted Nov 2024 to Nov 2025 inflation for that good!\n\nFinally, all these indexes are effectively just weighted averages across a wide range of stores and states. That doesn't mean that *your* individual store reflects that pricing, and different stores have different pricing strategies — which, under capitalism, can absolutely include price gouging the hell out of you if elasticity for that good is low in your area and they know you'll buy it anyway.\n\nFor example, John might be charged $30 per pound for a steak at his store and feel that's insane, while Laura might be charged $8 for a large bag of chips — they'll both have the *experience* of crazy inflation, even if John is actually paying less than average for chips and Laura is paying less than average for steak. The human mind pays particular attention to stimuli that are very negative; neither of them are likely to go through the store noticing all the goods that have only risen *a little*.\n\n**The best thing you can do to reduce the effect of inflation on your own wallet is to determine which goods are less inflated and shift your shopping preferences.** Right now, those goods include:\n\n* Fruits, espepcially citrus\n* Vegetables, especially potatoes and tomatoes\n* *Frozen* fruits and vegetables\n* Rice and pasta\n* White breads \n* Frozen bakery products\n* Chicken (compared to other meats)\n* Most dairy products\n\nFortunately, that mix is overall reasonably healthy. There are also a number of other products that are experiencing much less inflation or even deflation but are still priced quite high (e.g. eggs), so keep an eye on those products to see if they dip further.\n\nFinally, on a side note but an important one, **remember to ask for a raise!** Inflation very rarely ever dips below 0%, which means that goods are *always* rising in price overall. Your quality of life absolutely depends on your wage growth outpacing inflation, and the universe won't make that happen for you automatically. Overall wages are up slightly more than inflation right now, but if *you're* not experiencing that growth, you need to go ask for it.",

It should have been a tidal wave.\n\nIn isolation, this looks like bureaucratic incompetence. But history suggests this is a flashing red siren signaling the erosion of critical infrastructure: Trust.\n\nWestern civilization rose on a blueprint of six pillars, including property rights and fierce competition. But the keystone was the Rule of Law—the idea that the system is fair and accountability is universal.\n\nToday, we face a crisis of legitimacy. We see a two-tiered system where the average citizen is relentlessly pursued for minor tax errors, while massive institutions are deemed \"too big to audit\" or \"too big to fail.\"\n\nWhen trust in institutions evaporates, the economic incentive structure breaks down. Why build? Why innovate? This is the historical trajectory followed by Rome and the Ottoman Empire during their periods of decline from expansion into extraction.\n\nI’ve written a deep dive into the architecture of Western dominance and how the current institutional rot is dismantling it piece by piece.",

      "content": "$FLR (Fluor Corp) - The \"Boring\" Nuclear &amp; AI Play Trading at ~2x P/E (Not a Typo)\n\nListen, I know everyone is chasing the shiny new AI names or speculative nuclear SPACs that have zero revenue. But while you guys are looking at the sky, there is a monster hiding in the dirt that is actually building the stuff everyone else is hyping up.\nEnter Fluor Corporation ($FLR).\nThey are an engineering giant ($7B market cap) that the market still treats like a risky construction firm from 2018. But the fundamentals tell a completely different story.\nHere is the DD on why this might be the most undervalued play in the Nuclear/Data Center boom.\n1. The \"Stupid Cheap\" Valuation 💸\nLet’s just get the numbers out of the way because they look broken.\n-P/E Ratio (TTM): ~2.2x. (Yes, this is distorted by a gain from deconsolidating NuScale, but even if you normalize it, they are trading at a fraction of their peers).\n-Competitors: AECOM and Jacobs are trading at ~20x-25x earnings. Fluor is in the basement.\n-Cash: They are sitting on nearly $3 Billion in cash and marketable securities. That is almost half their market cap in liquid assets.\n-Buybacks: They know they are cheap. They bought back $70M of stock in Q3 alone and have authorized significantly more.\n2. The \"Hidden\" Nuclear Asset ($SMR) ☢️\nYou know NuScale Power ($SMR)? The only Small Modular Reactor (SMR) company with design approval from the US regulators? The one that pumps 20% every time someone whispers \"AI needs nuclear\"?\nFluor owns ~39% of NuScale.\nThey are literally the mothership. They have been selling off small chunks of their NuScale stake to fund buybacks of their own undervalued stock. It’s an arbitrage loop: sell expensive hype stock ($SMR) -&gt; buy cheap value stock ($FLR).\nPlus, who do you think is going to build the plants when NuScale actually deploys them? Fluor.\n3. The Pivot: Why This Isn't a Value Trap 🏗️\nThe reason Fluor stock crashed years ago was \"Fixed-Price Contracts.\" Basically, they promised to build a bridge for $1B, inflation hit, it cost $1.5B, and they ate the loss.\nThat Fluor is dead. Under CEO David Constable (the turnaround king), they have aggressively shifted to Reimbursable Contracts.\n-The Stat: ~80-97% of their new awards are now reimbursable.\n-Translation: If steel prices go up, the client pays, not Fluor. They have effectively de-risked their entire business model while the market wasn't looking.\n-Backlog: They have a $31.3 Billion backlog. That is years of guaranteed work locked in.\n4. The \"AI\" Angle (Data Centers) 💾\nEveryone talks about NVIDIA chips, but no one talks about the concrete shells those chips live in.\nFluor was recently named the \"Top Data Center Constructor\" by Data Centre Magazine. They are quietly building the massive hyperscale facilities that Microsoft/Google/Amazon need. They don't just dig holes; they do the complex cooling and power engineering that AI data centers require.\n5. The Bear Case (Risks) 🐻\nNo DD is complete without the bad stuff.\n-Legacy Projects: They still have a few \"loss-making\" fixed-price projects from the old days (mostly infrastructure) that they are finishing up. These are dragging on cash flow. Once these burn off (likely 2025/2026), margins should jump.\n-Cyclicality: If a recession hits and everyone stops building factories, Fluor hurts.\n-Litigation: It's construction. People sue each other. They have some ongoing disputes (like the Santos project).\n\nTL;DR\n$FLR is a misunderstood beast. The market thinks it’s a risky contractor; the balance sheet says it’s a cash-rich engineering firm. They are the shovels for the Nuclear Renaissance and the AI Infrastructure boom, trading at a valuation that makes no sense.\n\nPositions: Long stock. Not financial advice. Do your own research.",

      "content": "Boeing’s Debt Wall Is Approaching as Bond Markets Show Signs of Stress\nCompany News\n\nI wanted to try trading futures on Boeing (BA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) yesterday on Bitget. Boeing futures aren’t available there yet, but while digging deeper into BA, what stood out was how concerning the underlying credit picture looks compared to the equity narrative.\n\nBoeing’s total debt has reached roughly $53.3 billion, with a significant maturity wall approaching: about $4.3 billion due in 2025 and another $8 billion in 2026. Moody’s recently downgraded Boeing’s senior unsecured debt, citing concerns that free cash flow may fall short of covering these obligations, forcing the company to rely on refinancing or additional capital raising.\n\n[https://ratings.moodys.com/ratings-news/419450](https://ratings.moodys.com/ratings-news/419450)\n\nIn the bond market, several Boeing issues are starting to trade at levels more commonly associated with stressed periods. The 4.875% notes due May 2025 are yielding near levels last seen during past episodes of credit strain, while longer-dated bonds like the 5.805% 2050s have shown modest spread widening in recent trades.\n\nBoeing has secured a $3 billion credit facility to support liquidity, but this comes against the backdrop of long-term debt that has ballooned from under $10 billion a decade ago. While S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings currently maintain stable outlooks at BBB-, the lowest investment-grade tier, the scale of upcoming maturities raises questions about execution risk in a higher-for-longer rate environment.\n\nLeverage remains elevated, with funds from operations to debt projected around 20% next year, a level that leaves limited margin for error if deliveries slow or cash generation disappoints.\n\n*Edit:* S&amp;P revised its outlook to stable in October, pointing to improving aircraft production. Moody’s downgrade, however, highlights a more cautious view on the timing and durability of Boeing’s cash flow recovery.",

      "title": "Another TTD Post.",
      "content": "Another TTD Post.\n\nThis one is somewhat new after seeing some posts about it on here I'd think just see what's going on with it. \n\nTTD is an independent demand-side platform for programmatic advertising across channels and devices (including connected TV). Because it doesn’t own ad inventory, it positions itself as a more “unbiased” platform for advertisers and agencies. Economically, it’s a take-rate business, and that take rate has averaged around \\~20% of client ad spend over the past five years (per Morningstar). \n\nWhile a lot of other companies have a longer history, TTD has only IPO'ed in 2016. Despite this, TTD has consistently grown its Revenue, EPS, FCF and equity per share (on a ttm basis) quarterly on average 81% of the time. Not that they beat expectations but that the business is still growing the right direction. \n\nOn valuation, the stock still screens expensive on most lenses: roughly \\~6.4x sales, \\~8.1x gross profit, \\~41x net income, \\~20x operating cash flow, and \\~26x free cash flow. Even so, those multiples are closer to the low end of TTD’s own historical range, which suggests the market has already compressed expectations. The key question is whether growth is “earning” the multiple. Revenue growth in the mid-20s and net income growth in the mid-20s/30s doesn’t fully justify \\~41x earnings on its own, but free cash flow growth in the mid-30s/40s lines up better with the \\~20–26x cash flow / free cash flow range. This reminds me of other low historical ratios like PayPal which after a while has compressed its ratios from like 100 to what they are now. \n\nOne additional wrinkle is stock-based compensation. TTD often points out that dilution has been limited in practice (diluted EPS frequently only about a cent below basic), which could mean dilution concerns are overstated. I do seek more community input on that front. \n\n[More charts here. ](https://companycharts.substack.com/p/the-trade-desk-tdd)",

      "content": "Is a 20+ year time horizon enough to justify a teach heavy concentration?\n\nI’m wondering if having a 20+ year time horizon means investing heavily in tech would out perform a more diversified approach. Tech comes with larger volatility, but due to the length of my time horizon, would these swings still out perform the broad market over a longer time frame? Essentially will volatility drag erode the CAGR of heavy tech investment over 20 years compared to a diversified approach? ",

I had been speculating/investing in Bitcoin for the past 1.5 years or so and came to the realization that the volatility was too much for me on a daily basis. I recently sold all Bitcoin holdings and went to a 3 fund portfolio holding 33% DIA, 33% VOO and 33% QQQ to cover all 3 major indexes. I am wondering if the opinion would be to add more than these 3 indexes such as a Bond ETF or a Dividend ETF. I am currently 36 years old. I am investing 20% of my paycheck each week to these 3 funds equally. If I add a Bond ETF or a Dividend ETF I feel as if I will be missing out on possible growth to this portfolio. Thanks for the opinions in advance. ",

Is there any reason to choose different index funds for each of them?\n\nI started a Roth IRA in Robinhood when I felt competent enough to begin investing for my retirement. I created a personal brokerage account for more risky investments, like individual stocks, to try to beat my HYSA returns of 4%, which I’ve done. I got a new job that offers a Roth 401K, which I believe to be better than a traditional 401K from my research, and an HSA, which I am inclined to use due to my T1 Diabetes based on how beneficial they appear to be.

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Date:** 2025-12-20 | **Time Horizon:** Day | **Sentiment:** **Neutral to Cautiously Bearish**\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Neutral to Cautiously Bearish**\n*   **Retail Sentiment (Reddit):** Mixed but leaning toward speculative froth and anxiety. High engagement with options trading success stories (#2, #6) and meme stocks (GME #10, #12, RKLB #7) indicates persistent retail speculation. However, themes of job market distress (#8), political friction (#1, #11, #15), and macroeconomic shifts (#3) introduce a layer of underlying concern and distraction from pure bullish momentum.\n*   **Institutional/News Sentiment (RSS):** Defensive and thematic. News flow emphasizes long-term structural shifts (China's rise, defense growth, quarter-century economic review) and seeks yield/safety (dividend stocks, precious metals). The lack of breaking \"risk-on\" catalysts suggests a market in consolidation or awaiting direction.\n*   **Macro & Technical Data:** Confirms a cautious environment. The elevated VIX (16.87) and 10Y Yield (4.12%) combined with a still-higher Fed Funds Rate (3.64%) point to lingering inflation and growth concerns. The equity risk premium (4.33%) is not wide enough to signal a clear bargain, supporting a neutral stance.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES:**\n*   **Regulatory & Political Risk:** Prominent in both retail and professional spheres. Reddit highlights an FTC monopoly probe (#1) and tax policy debates (#11). RSS news notes Fitch downgrading Gabon on debt risks, extending the theme of sovereign/policy scrutiny.\n*   **Macroeconomic Transition:** A dominant professional theme. The end of Japan's zero-rate policy (\"free money era\" #3) is a significant global liquidity shift. RSS articles dissect a \"25-Year Shift\" in China and the economic legacy of crises, indicating a market grappling with a new macro regime.\n*   **Speculative vs. Defensive Positioning:** A clear dichotomy. Retail chatter is focused on high-beta plays (options, meme stocks, crypto). In contrast, financial news is focused on income (dividend stocks), hard assets (gold/silver ETFs), and identifying secular growth in defense—a classic defensive sector.\n*   **Corporate-Specific Catalysts:** Individual stock stories are driving extreme moves (LAZR +174%, BBAI +11%, NVDA +3.9%) and news (Ford's $5B problem, Palantir stock-split watch, Tesla pay package ruling). This indicates a stock-picker's market where macro direction is lacking.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS:**\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (Bearish for Crypto/Speculative Assets):** **Japan's rate hike (#3)** is a critical signal. The withdrawal of a major source of global cheap money is a headwind for liquidity-sensitive assets like Bitcoin and high-PE growth stocks.\n*   **Gamma & Options Dynamics:** With weekly OPEX in 6 days and **MODERATE Gamma Exposure**, expect amplified volatility, especially in highly-shorted or meme stocks (e.g., GME) as dealers hedge their positions. Retail's options fascination (#2, #6) adds fuel to this.\n*   **Sector Signal:** RSS news explicitly frames **Defense** as a \"Growth\" sector—a rare combination that often attracts capital during geopolitical uncertainty and budget cycles.\n*   **Contrarian Sentiment Signal:** The celebratory retail options post (#2) and pervasive \"can't find a job due to AI\" narrative (#8) can be interpreted as a minor contrarian warning sign of excessive speculation and pessimism, respectively.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Liquidity Drain:** The tangible impact of Japan's policy shift may be underestimated, risking a slow bleed in speculative assets.\n    2.  **Political & Regulatory Surprises:** The FTC probe into Collectors Holdings and tax talk could spill over to broader market sentiment, especially for collectibles, fintech, or high-profile M&A.\n    3.  **Idiosyncratic Volatility:** Extreme single-stock moves (LAZR, PRPH) amid low reported volume are a warning of fragile, illiquid market pockets that can break sharply.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Thematic Defense:** The professional shift to viewing defense as a growth area provides a fundamental rationale for positioning.\n    2.  **Yield in Volatility:** The search for dividends and precious metals is a rational response to the current macro setup and may outperform if volatility (VIX) ticks higher.\n    3.  **Gamma-Driven Moves:** Skilled traders can position for increased volatility into the 12/26 OPEX, particularly in names with high options interest.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:**\n*   **SECTOR: DEFENSE (e.g., LMT, NOC, RTX)** - A direct response to the RSS growth stock thesis. Provides a hedge against geopolitical risk and benefits from bipartisan budget support. Look for entries on market-wide weakness.\n*   **GDX / SIL:** - Precious metals are in the news for a reason. With real yields potentially peaking and global uncertainty rising, these ETFs offer a hedge. **GDX** (gold miners) offers more beta; **SIL** (silver miners) has industrial metal exposure. Monitor the 10Y yield for direction.\n*   **GME / Meme Basket:** - **High Risk, Tactical Only.** Gamma exposure into 12/26 OPEX combined with persistent retail interest (#10, #12) sets up for a potential volatility spike. This is a trade, not an investment. Use tight risk controls.\n*   **BITCOIN / CRYPTO:** - **Caution Advised.** The \"Japan put\" is being removed. This is a structural headwind. Avoid long positions until the market fully digests this new liquidity environment. Monitor for a breakdown below key support levels.\n*   **NVDA:** - The +3.93% move on the snapshot is notable amid a flat-to-down tape. It suggests AI leadership remains intact, but it is now a **bellwether for risk appetite**. A failure to hold gains would be a significant negative signal for the broader tech sector.\n*   **WATCH: VIX Term Structure & 10Y Yield** - The key to the next major move. A steepening VIX curve (front-month rising faster) signals near-term fear. A 10Y yield breaking decisively above 4.2% would pressure growth stocks; a fall below 4.0% could trigger a relief rally.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is in a transitional phase, caught between speculative retail impulses and a defensive professional rotation. The dominant new macro fact is the withdrawal of Japanese liquidity. Prioritize capital preservation and thematic positions (Defense, Yield) over broad index bets. Trade tactically around OPEX, but invest thematically around secular shifts.",

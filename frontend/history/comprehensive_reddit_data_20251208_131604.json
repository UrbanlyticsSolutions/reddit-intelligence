Discovery shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share in a hostile takeover move. This comes after Netflix won the bidding war for Warner Bros.’ film studio and HBO Max, while choosing not to acquire WBD’s TV networks. Paramount has maintained that keeping WBD’s assets together makes more sense for long-term shareholder value, and this bid seems to reflect that view. The outcome now depends largely on how WBD shareholders respond.\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/paramount-skydance-hostile-bid-wbd-netflix.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/paramount-skydance-hostile-bid-wbd-netflix.html)",

It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government, which has blocked imports of less powerful chips, such as Nvidia’s H20.\n\nThe move, which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, could bolster Nvidia’s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide.\n\nThe US enacted strict export restrictions under the Biden Administration in an effort to prevent China from catching up on AI. But some in the White House believe those restrictions have more or less failed, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n    \n[Source](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/08/2025/commerce-to-open-up-exports-of-nvidia-h200-chips-to-china)",

Confluent's ​shares surged nearly 30% in premarket trading, while IBM fell more ‌than 2%.\n\n&gt;The Confluent stock is up nearly 44% since October 7, the last trading session before Reuters reported that the company was exploring a sale after attracting acquisition interest.\n\n&gt;STRING OF ACQUISITIONS\n\n&gt;IBM has long turned to deal-making to gain scale and fend off competition, especially in cloud computing.\n\n&gt;In April last year, ⁠the company bought cloud firm HashiCorp in ​a deal valued at $6.4 billion. Its $34 billion ​deal for Red Hat in 2019 is credited by analysts as the central catalyst that boosted its cloud business.\n\n&gt;IBM will fund ‍the Confluent deal ⁠with cash on hand and the transaction is expected to close by the middle of 2026.\n\n&gt;The deal is expected to boost IBM's adjusted ⁠core earnings within the first full year of the transaction's completion and it will ‌add to free cash flow in year two.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1up2pwakz5g1.png?width=1591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=504349fa725c21eef43b4cf37f9f9790d642445d",

Waymo is one of the largest positions in Tiger’s 2024 fund.\n\nWaymo declined to comment.\n\nThis year, Waymo has also announced a slew of expansions, including its debut on freeways in three cities, and autonomous driving in cities including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando.\n\nThe latest milestone is also another sign that Waymo is continuing to push ahead of aspiring self-driving competitor Tesla, which has run limited pilots in Austin and operates a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area.\n\nTesla vehicles include human drivers or safety supervisors on board and are not driverless like Waymo’s fleet vehicles.\n\nAccording to Tesla’s latest earnings call, executives said the company hit a quarter of a million miles with its fleet in Austin, and more than one million in the Bay Area. In July, Waymo announced 100 million total fully autonomous miles.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html)",

      "content": "$469k on SOFI, finally sold on potential future correction, but still long term bullish\n\nLiquidated my SOFI position last week.  This was about half my portfolio.  I love the company and think they'll go much further in the long run, however, I personally believe there's an impending market correction inbound and I want to sit on majority cash until then.  \n\nI don't think it's a \"huge bubble crash that'll destroy capitalism!\" type event, but definitely a correction sometime between April - June next year.  Basically it's based on historic events where you had run away crazy insane investing into the new \"it\" thing and even when valuations held up, hype wore off, and while spending didn't stop it was reduced which caused a drawn down/correction.  This is what I think will happen to AI on a significant scale.  Not a crash, but a correction of about 25% - 30% draw down over a 3 - 8 month period followed by a rebound.  40% drop or more, in this administration, highly unlikely. \n\nOverall I think SOFI will be okay and bounce around $25 - $29 until the correction and then hit around $18 - $22 at the low point.  Long term, very bullish though.  2028/2029 they will be hitting all time highs again and more.  SP500 inclusion and could easily be a $75 billion - $100 billion market cap in early 2030s.  \n\nBut until then I'm going to take advantage of potential upcoming opportunities to increase my gains even more.  Not quite sure what the move will be, I have months to wait,  but I'm sitting on $600k until then.  I have other positions currently open that I'm going to ride through the correction that I feel will fair better long term through the correction, but when the dust settles (around late 2026 - early/mid 2027)  I'll jump back into SOFI, and take advantage of other opportunities at the time as well.\n\nIf this doesn't happen?  Oh well.  I've been apart of WSB since 2016, and if I have learned anything it's: There's ALWAYS another play. ",

Combs, who has been both an investment officer at Berkshire and CEO of Geico, will be moving to JPMorgan Chase.\nAt JPMorgan, he’ll lead a newly created Security and Resiliency Initiative focused on direct equity investments across defense, aerospace, healthcare, and energy.

Right now, Tesla is trading at around 210x forward earnings, making it one of the most expensive stocks in the entire S&amp;P 500 second only to Warner Bros. Discovery, and well ahead of Palantir. That valuation already assumes big success in areas like robotics and artificial intelligence, according to the bank. The downgrade isn’t a call that Tesla’s future vision is wrong it’s more about the stock price already reflecting those ambitions. In other words, the growth story may still be intact, but the risk-reward at these levels looks stretched. Feels like this is less about Tesla as a company and more about how much future investors are already paying for today.\n\n  \nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sky-high-valuation-prompts-160032022.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sky-high-valuation-prompts-160032022.html)",

Right now, Tesla is trading at around 210x forward earnings, making it one of the most expensive stocks in the entire S&amp;P 500 second only to Warner Bros. Discovery, and well ahead of Palantir. That valuation already assumes big success in areas like robotics and artificial intelligence, according to the bank. The downgrade isn’t a call that Tesla’s future vision is wrong it’s more about the stock price already reflecting those ambitions. In other words, the growth story may still be intact, but the risk-reward at these levels looks stretched. Feels like this is less about Tesla as a company and more about how much future investors are already paying for today.\n\n  \nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sky-high-valuation-prompts-160032022.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sky-high-valuation-prompts-160032022.html)",

      "content": "AI is hijacking the grid and the food sector is getting crushed first\n\nEveryone is hyped on AI.\n\nAlmost nobody is talking about what it is doing to the power market.\n\n\n\nAI data centers have pushed electricity prices up roughly 267% in key hubs. That is not a rounding error. That is a system level shock, and it is just getting started.\n\n\n\nHere is the brutal part from the Forbes breakdown:\n\nAI facilities lock in long term power contracts.\n\nFood companies do not.\n\n\n\nSo food takes the hit first.\n\n\n\nSupermarkets, cold warehouses, processing plants, distribution hubs, all of them depend on nonstop power, and they are the ones getting whatever is left at whatever price the grid spits out. No leverage, no protection, no real stability.\n\n\n\nThis is exactly why on site power is moving from “nice upgrade” to “non negotiable.”\n\nMicrogrids are not a luxury. They are the only clean way out of AI driven price chaos. Local generation, local storage, local control. You step outside utility politics and outside a bidding war you will never win.\n\n\n\nIf the market actually understood how aggressively AI demand is reshaping the grid, microgrid operators and grid edge players would not still be stuck in micro cap territory.\n\n\n\nMy view on where this segment belongs once that reality sinks in:\n\na re rate zone around 5.20 to 6.00 makes sense as the pressure ramps and adoption spreads.\n\n\n\nNot financial advice. Just the logical outcome when an entire industry is slowly priced out of the electricity market. \n\n\n\nSource:  \"This Company Says It Can Fix The Food System’s Energy Problem\" By Daphne Ewing-Chow, Forbes.",

Discovery WBD 6.28%increase; green up pointing triangle Monday, taking its case for acquiring the storied entertainment company directly to shareholders just days after Warner agreed to a deal with Netflix. \n\nParamount, run by David Ellison, is arguing that its all-cash $30 a share offer for all of Warner, owner of networks such as CNN, TBS and HGTV as well as the HBO Max streaming service, is a better deal for shareholders and more likely to pass regulatory muster. Paramount said its offer “provides shareholders $18 billion more in cash than the Netflix NFLX -2.89%decrease; red down pointing triangle consideration.”\n\nThe offer, “provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,” Ellison said in a statement.\n\nNetflix agreed to pay $72 billion, or $27.75 a share, for Warner’s studio and HBO Max streaming business after the entertainment company splits itself in two, in a cash-and-stock deal the companies announced Friday. \n\nParamount’s decision to take its offer directly to Warner’s shareholders could set up a messy, public battle for the future of Warner’s coveted assets like HBO, Harry Potter and DC Comics.

However, sentiment is not uniform.\n*   **Retail Sentiment (Reddit):** **Extremely Bullish & Speculative.** Dominated by excitement over:\n    *   **Earnings Catalysts:** Concentrated hype around **GameStop (GME)** Q3 earnings, with predictions of a sixth consecutive profitable quarter.\n    *   **Cryptocurrency:** Enthusiasm from Michael Saylor's massive Bitcoin purchase and low-fee large transfers, reinforcing a \"digital gold\" narrative.\n    *   **M&A Drama:** High engagement on the Paramount-WBD hostile bid saga.\n*   **Institutional/News Sentiment (RSS):** **Neutral-to-Cautious.** Focus is on major corporate actions (M&A, IPO) and structural shifts (rise of Active ETFs). Notable concern flagged for **Netflix (NFLX)** regarding Warner deal risks.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES**\n1.  **Media Industry Consolidation & Turmoil:** The hostile bid by **Paramount for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)** is the dominant cross-source theme. It's driving retail discussion and professional news, creating a clear narrative of industry upheaval and potential value realization.\n2.  **Cryptocurrency Institutionalization & Retail Adoption:** Michael Saylor's corporate accumulation, BlackRock ETF flows, and discussions of high-value, low-cost transfers underscore the deepening integration of crypto into traditional finance.\n3.  **Retail-Driven Earnings Speculation:** **GameStop (GME)** is a singular focus of retail traders anticipating a strong Q3 report, creating a potential \"sell the news\" or momentum event.\n4.  **Macro Data Ambiguity:** The delayed October PPI report (Reddit) introduces a short-term uncertainty into inflation tracking, potentially causing market hesitation until January.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (M&A):** **WBD's +4.41% move** is a direct signal of the market pricing in the high-premium ($108.4B) hostile bid. **NFLX's weakness** (per Bloomberg) is a correlated signal of perceived competitive risk.\n*   **Retail Momentum Signal:** The intense Reddit focus on **GME earnings** is a high-conviction sentiment signal for a potential short-term volatility spike around the report.\n*   **Crypto Confidence Signal:** **MicroStrategy's (MSTR)** continued multi-billion dollar Bitcoin purchases is a powerful fundamental signal of corporate treasury conviction, likely supporting BTC and related equities/ETFs.\n*   **Technical/Volatility Signal:** **WVE's +147.26% explosion** (likely Wave Life Sciences) on no provided volume context is a warning of extreme, news-driven biotech volatility. **PAVS's +31%** move is similar for small-caps.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Earnings Letdown Risk:** The overwhelmingly bullish retail setup for **GME** creates asymmetric risk. Any earnings miss or guidance disappointment could trigger a severe reversal.\n    2.  **M&A Breakdown Risk:** If the Paramount-WBD deal faces regulatory hurdles or falls apart, **WBD** could give back its gains rapidly, and related media stocks could see heightened volatility.\n    3.  **Speculative Bubble Risk in Small-Caps:** Moves like **WVE** and **PAVS** indicate frothy conditions in low-float, high-beta names, prone to sharp corrections.\n    4.  **Data Gap Risk:** The delayed PPI report leaves a blind spot in inflation analysis, increasing dependency on other data points and Fed commentary.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **M&A Arbitrage & Ripple Effects:** Opportunities in **WBD** (deal acceptance/premium), potential targets in the media sector, and losers in streaming (e.g., **NFLX** concerns).\n    2.  **Crypto Correlated Plays:** Strength in **Bitcoin** likely flows to **MSTR**, **Coinbase (COIN)**, and Bitcoin ETFs (**IBIT, GBTC**).\n    3.  **Earnings Volatility Plays:** High implied volatility around **GME** earnings presents options trading opportunities for both directions.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n*   **WBD:** Monitor for official board response to the hostile bid. Current price action suggests the market is pricing in a high probability of deal completion or a higher bid. A \"hold\" or \"accumulate on dips\" stance is warranted for event-driven traders.\n*   **SECTOR: Media & Entertainment:** Expect continued volatility. Scrutinize **PARA** (Paramount) for financing details and **NFLX** for any strategic counter-moves. Smaller content/studio players may become speculation targets.\n*   **GME:** **Extreme Caution Advised.** The retail \"echo chamber\" has set a very high bar. Consider hedging long positions or structuring trades that benefit from a volatility crush *after* earnings, regardless of direction.\n*   **MSTR / BITCOIN-RELATED ASSETS:** The Saylor accumulation is a strong fundamental tailwind. Use pullbacks as potential entry points for exposure to the corporate Bitcoin adoption theme.\n*   **SECTOR: Active & Thematic ETFs:** The RSS news highlights 2025 as \"The Year of Active ETFs.\" Research funds like **TECL** (3x Long Tech) mentioned, but understand the extreme leverage risk. Favor core, lower-expense active ETF launches from major issuers.\n*   **MACRO: Watch Bond Yields.** With the 10Y at 4.11% and a PPI data gap, be alert to shifts in the yield curve driven by other inflation data (CPI) or Fed speakers, which could impact growth/tech valuations.\n\n---\n**CONCLUSION:** The market is being driven by distinct, high-impact narratives rather than a unified macro trend. **Focus is paramount.** The Paramount-WBD saga and GME earnings are the two primary engines of near-term volatility. Trade these themes with defined risk parameters, as the underlying retail sentiment is euphoric and prone to sudden shifts. The broader tape remains supported, but idiosyncratic stories dominate the action.",

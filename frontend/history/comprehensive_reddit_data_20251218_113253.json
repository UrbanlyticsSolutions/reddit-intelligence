(Please correct me if I'm wrong)\n\nHere is the data:  \n[https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=M](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=M)\n\nDallas Fed Energy Survey Dec 17, 2025 where the quote was taken.

      "content": "The first time I used a crypto-backed loan.... it felt like cheating.\n\nLast winter I tried a crypto-backed loan because I didn’t want to sell my coins. I locked up about $10,000 worth of BTC and borrowed $5,500 cash. The app called that “55% LTV”. All it means is: loan divided by collateral value.\n\nThe terms said a warning would hit around 70% and an auto-sell could happen around 80%. I read it, nodded, and moved on. Big mistake. Because the math changes fast when price drops.\n\nThat night BTC slid hard. My $10,000 collateral became roughly $7,800 in a few hours. My loan was still $5,500, so my LTV jumped to about 70%+. I got a message: “margin call, 24 hours to cure.” Cure means add more collateral or repay part of the loan.\n\nI tried adding $1,000 more BTC from another wallet. Network fees were spiking and my transfer sat pending. I tried repaying $500 instead, but my bank transfer wouldn’t clear instantly. Support chat replied like “high volume, expect delays.” The timer didn’t care.\n\nBy morning the app showed “partial liquidation executed.” They sold a chunk of my BTC to push the ratio back down, then charged an execution fee on what they sold. I wasn’t wiped out, but I did sell at the worst moment without choosing to.\n\nIf you ever use these loans, assume a 30% drop can happen any random day. Borrow lower than you think, keep extra collateral ready, and make sure you can move money fast.",

Secure a contract at a loss -&gt; \n\n2. Use contract to get a loan/funding -&gt; \n\n3. Build out infrastructure/acquire GPUs -&gt; \n\n4. Repeat -&gt; \n\n5. Hope to eventually become a competing AWS alternative for AI cloud solutions.\n\nThe problem: \n\nToday, the overwhelming majority of NBIS's revenue comes from hyper scalers looking to offload demand. NBIS is providing them the compute at a loss. \n\nAt anytime a hyperscaler(s) can choose to no longer use NBIS when unfavorable, which will completely cripple the company's finances.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are currently investing extremely heavily into their own data centers to keep up with demand, so the chance of Nebius acquiring customers that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, can't provide supply to in the future is low.\n\nThere is also huge uncertainty regarding NBIS's future cashflows, demand, and financial solvency. Shareholders may unknowingly be diluted to raise funds, a forced buy-out can happen, etc.\n\nOverall, NBIS is a great opportunity to become a generational bag holder. Simply ignore the financials and choose to invest off of vibes, chasing hype, etc., and you may potentially find yourself holding a bag for years to come.",

The basic idea was straightforward:\n\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data center capacity planned over the next five years, and data centers are extreme power consumers. In the U.S., a large share of power generation still comes from hydrocarbons, especially natural gas. Companies that provide that energy appear to be overlooked.\n\nWhat that post didn’t get into was a deeper dive into the energy companies themselves — specifically, which ones might actually offer attractive opportunities today.\n\nSo I decided to do that. I used a tool I built that ingests SEC filings for each company and supplements them with industry data from:\n\n* American Petroleum Institute\n* U.S. Energy Information Administration\n* American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers\n* Society of Petroleum Engineers\n* Journal of Petroleum Technology\n* World Oil\n* Oil and Gas Journal\n* Hydrocarbon Processing\n\nI produced 10+ reports across different energy companies. After going through all of them, the companies that stood out to me were:\n\n* [Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/BjArBLK0WHRj) – this was the most interesting to me given that it generated \\~$8.1B of TTM free cash flow in 2024 on a \\~$73B market cap (a mid-teens FCF yield if sustained), while the stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months (+0.9%). It trades at \\~7x EV/EBITDA and \\~12x TTM EPS, despite controlling \\~20.1B boe of long-life 2P oil sands reserves and producing \\~1.36M boe/d. The valuation appears to reflect market skepticism around long-duration durability and Canadian policy risk more than near-term cash generation.\n* [Matador Resources (MTDR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/eXS9JPBjEbOK) – MTDR stood out because balance-sheet stress is not evident in the current numbers: net debt sits below \\~1x EBITDA, production continues to grow in the Delaware Basin, and the company owns majority-interest, largely fee-based midstream assets (San Mateo / Pronto) that support cash-flow stability. Despite this, the stock trades around \\~3x EV/EBITDA, a multiple more commonly associated with higher leverage or structurally challenged E&amp;Ps.\n* [Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/YDjQ0bF0lQjM) – In contrast to the commodity-exposed producers, EPD’s appeal is the consistency of its cash generation: operating cash flow has stayed above \\~$7.5B annually since 2021, distribution coverage has run \\~1.6–1.7x, and the partnership retained \\~$3.24B in 2024 after distributions. Units trade around \\~7.5x EV/EBITDA despite this level of cash-flow stability and balance-sheet strength.\n\nI’m also sharing the reports for the other companies I analyzed in case anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [CHEVRON CORP (CVX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/dPtgVsyaOVZt)\n* [ANTERO RESOURCES Corp (AR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/IDhlgnNAdAUB)\n* [AEMETIS, INC (AMTX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/qWCT1bsvIyDj)\n* [NextDecade Corp (NEXT)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/JJZlaAD3JrFK)\n* [AMEREN CORP (AEE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/bz6cvzIIw5KP)\n* [SM Energy Co (SM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/2rQK36fGNwaD)\n* [Crescent Energy Co (CRGY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/DDSGWbDUlote)\n* [EXXON MOBIL CORP (XOM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/p9Lzg0rb1qKZ)\n* [OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP (OXY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/8ZSEPD2k7oDk)\n* [Vital Energy, Inc. (VTLE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/sYfs8N4YJHVR)\n* [WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. (WMB)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/z2j2kNtxUEXR)\n\nCusious to hear which energy stocks others here are following. Any interesting ones I missed?",

I've got my 401k and an emergency fund set, so now I'm looking to open a brokerage account for some growth oriented investing. I know trying to time the market is a fool's game, so I'm more interested in finding companies I believe in for the next few years.\n\nAll the hype seems to be about AI and semiconductors right now, and the prices reflect that. It feels a bit frothy. I'm trying to look past the current trends and think about what might be a good buy for 2026 and beyond. I keep seeing lists for the \"best growth stocks 2026\" but they all just seem to list the same mega cap tech companies.\n\nI'm not afraid of some risk, but I also don't want to just chase what's already shot up. I'm interested in sectors that might be overlooked now but have solid long term potential.\n\nHow do you even begin to research a company for a 3-5 year time horizon instead of just quarterly earnings?  \nAre there sectors you think are undervalued right now that could be strong contenders for the best growth stocks 2026?  \nHow much does current Fed policy and interest rates play into your long term stock picks?\n\nI'm not looking for specific tickers, more like a framework for how to think about this. If anyone has resources or a strategy they use for finding longer-term growth opportunities, I'd really appreciate it.",

      "content": "A Survey of writings on the AI bubble\n\nThere's been a lot of diverging view points on whether we're in an AI bubble (even this week there was some drama with Oracle and Blue Owl). \n\nI wanted to [share my on thoughts](https://eastwind.substack.com/p/power-overwhelming) &amp; learnings from reading a lot of things on the internet:\n\n* My own takeaways from looking at a bunch of data, which I wrote in my [blog](https://eastwind.substack.com/p/power-overwhelming).\n* Scour the internet for other popular writings that the capture the current \"zeitgeist\". \n\nMy takeaways (from looking at tech companies, VC funding , data center depreciation vs. traditional data centers) are the following:\n\n* We're fine from a fundamentals perspective, at least for the first half of 2026 (AI revenues are growing, models are improving, categories like coding are delivering ROI)\n* If there's a crash, it will be due to sentiment, or if OpenAI / Anthropic miss their revenue projections\n* There are concerns around quality of revenues + ROI for specific industries. We see this both at public companies like Salesforce (with Agentforce) as well as startups.\n* Specific categories of SaaS will not be disrupted by AI in the medium term &amp; SaaS overall is pretty beaten down so those companies will rerate. Some software infra companies give indirect exposure to AI startups (e.g. OpenAI spends a ton on Datadog) \n* There might be a big revenue hole once current capex comes online in 2027/2028. But right now we're generating tokens from the capex from 2021-2024, and relative to capex from those years we're ok\n* AI SaaS revenues + OpenAI / Anthropic revenue growth can't justify capex. Big Tech's internal workloads (e.g. Meta / Google using AI for better ad targeting) matter way more (e.g. better ad targeting, Google serving inference workloads from AI overviews, etc.)\n* Current depreciation schedules (6 years for GPUs) don't make sense at all\n\n  \nAnd some learnings from my readings (some links) don't have notes because as they didn't provide things that were net new information):\n\n[*Can the AI Boom Pay for Itself?*](https://www.thetimes.blog/p/can-the-ai-boom-pay-for-itself)\n\n* If tokens generated increase \\~9-12% monthly (for inference), then we're on track to meet capex. The author does think we're in a phase of overbuild, however.\n\n  \n[*Sam Altman’s Dirty DRAM Deal*](https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/sam-altman-s-dirty-dram-deal) \n\n* The current memory price spike is due to two simultaneous deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for 40% of the world's DRAM supply. This basically triggered a panic buying from everyone else\n\n[*Is It a Bubble?*](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/is-it-a-bubble) *(Oaktree Captial)* \n\n* Companies that usher in a game-changing technology are not necessarily the beneficiaries of said technology (e.g. auto companies).\n\n  \n[*Is AI a bubble?*](https://www.exponentialview.co/p/is-ai-a-bubble)\n\n* Uses 5 gauges to measure signs of an AI bubble: economic strain (capex / GDP), industry strain (investment / revenue), revenue growth (revenue doubling time), valuation heat (PE ratio), and funding quality. When two of the gauges are red, it means we are in trouble\n* Right now, industry strain is approaching red, economic strain and valuation heat is approaching yellow\n\n  \n[*Thoughts on the AI buildout*](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/thoughts-on-the-ai-buildout)\n\n* Curtailment (whereby data centers voluntarily shut down during peak periods) will unlock 76GW of additional power because you need to build less peak power\n\n[*Surviving the AI Capex Boom*](https://www.sparklinecapital.com/post/surviving-the-ai-capex-boom)\n\n* More of a macro piece. Looking back at history companies with high asset growth had a tendency to underperform. This \"implies\" that our Mag 7 companies might not be so attractive in the future.\n\n  \n[*Forget the Bubble Talk: NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL Are Playing Completely Different AI Games*](https://alphaseeker84.substack.com/p/forget-the-bubble-talk-nvda-msft)\n\n* Each large company in the AI race has their own optimization function (e.g. Microsoft wants agents drive the bulk of usage across its suite of products like Office)\n* SLMs (small language models) push inference away from cloud to the edge, this can cap the growth of cloud revenues\n* Incumbents will be ok, but clouds one tier below will get hurt\n\n[*Exclusive: Here's How Much OpenAI Spends On Inference and Its Revenue Share With Microsoft*](https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai_docs/)\n\n* Reportedly viewed leaked documents showing how much money OpenAI sends to Microsoft (OAI has a 20% rev share with Microsoft). The author states that based on this number, OAI’s “implied” revenue is significantly lower than OAI’s publicly stated revenue numbers\n* If this accusation is true, OpenAI revenues are far below what has been publicly reported. There are several explanations for this (one of the reasons is Microsoft also resells OpenAI’s APIs, in which case OAI would capture some %), so the number here could be net payments.\n\n[*The Case Against Generative AI*](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-case-against-generative-ai/)\n\n* Concerns revolve around the current AI revenues (author estimates it to be $61B) vs. capex and AI margins\n* My take is that the author has not accounted for the pace of revenue growth (which was $0 a few years ago) nor big tech’s internal workloads (Meta serving better ads).\n* Not accounting for the shift towards cheaper open-source models (e.g. Airbnb using Qwen models)\n* Doesn’t account for the lag from capex vs. revenue. The AI revenues we’re seeing come from capex over the past few years.\n\n[*Boom, bubble, bust, boom. Why should AI be different?*](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01kaqaf6pnjybzgtafdrfzgsz1/)\n\n* Some startup deals are reminiscent of those in the dot com bubble (e.g. $1B seed rounds). This affects \\~tens of billions in cloud spend if there are enough startup implosions and VCs pull back\n* Embrace of Chinese open-source models could mean margins for US closed-source labs collapse\n\n[*Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Trouble*](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/bubble-bubble-toil-and-trouble)\n\n[*Goldman Sachs Spotlight: “AI: in a bubble?”*](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/top-of-mind/ai-in-a-bubble)\n\n[*The Four Horsemen of the AI Infrastructure Buildout*](https://www.viksnewsletter.com/p/the-four-horsemen-of-ai-infra)",

      "content": "Nvidia in the Middle of Market Trends &amp; AI Competition\n\nNvidia’s price action continues to be shaped by broader market forces and the intense competition in the AI sector. Recent inflation data has given tech stocks some breathing room, while Micron Technology’s strong earnings report added fuel to the rebound. Still, concerns remain about China’s aggressive push into AI infrastructure and semiconductors, which could challenge Nvidia’s long term positioning.\n\n* **Market Rebound**: The Nasdaq has bounced back thanks to favorable inflation numbers, creating a more positive environment for Nvidia and other tech names.\n* **Micron’s Impact**: Micron jumped 9.3% after earnings, which could help boost confidence across the sector, including Nvidia.\n* **China’s AI Push**: Heavy investment from China in AI and chip technology is a looming risk that Nvidia can’t ignore.\n\nOverall, Nvidia is benefiting from short term tailwinds but still faces big structural challenges. Curious how others here are positioning, do you see the rebound as sustainable, or just another temporary lift before competition and macro pressures weigh in again?",

It’s a great company with amazing fundamentals and a solid ass moat. Their land and expand way of doing business has a solid track record of consistent margin expansion and ARR growth.\n2.\t⁠Is it cheap and not a value trap? Well, the stock was beaten down this year for 2 reasons: AI fear and some execution risk on M&amp;A. To me, neither of these things are real disrupters for the business. On top of that valuation is close to April level. While I won’t say it’s cheap, the valuation is certainly starting to make sense here.\n\nAnother thing I want to mention is the AI bubble. When people start realize that the current LLMs can’t reach AGI and hyper scalers won’t get their capex money back, the music will stop. And that’s when these beaten down quality software gets liquidity flow.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

      "content": "Has anyone used HR analytics software or HR AI solutions to spot hidden inefficiencies early?\n\nEvery company has that moment where something feels off, but no one can pinpoint what it is. Deadlines start slipping. A team that used to be fast suddenly moves slower.  \nBudgets stretch further than expected. Meetings multiply without producing decisions. Leaders start sensing friction but theyre not sure where it’s coming from. Is it workload imbalance?  A manager overwhelmed? A team operating without clarity? Resources being allocated the wrong way? Or something deeper, like burnout creeping through an entire department? The truth is inefficiency rarely announces itself. It builds quietly, hidden inside tools, systems, and processes that no one has time to examine. By the time the symptoms are loud enough for executives to notice, the problem has already become expensive. HR is expected to diagnose these issues yet theyre asked to do it without the one thing that would make it possible: connected, clear data. You cant fix what you cant see and most inefficiencies stay invisible far longer than they should and HR AI solutions are needed!!",

      "content": "MU Blowout up over 15% Premarket Is This a Bullish Signal for Tech?\n\nMicron just posted a blowout Q1 FY2026 with results across the board beating expectations. Revenue came in at 13.64 billion dollars up 57 percent year over year and 21 percent quarter over quarter well above the 12.92 billion consensus. Profitability improved sharply with GAAP gross margin rising to 56 percent up 17.6 points year over year and 11.3 points sequentially beating the 51 percent estimate. GAAP net income reached 5.24 billion dollars up 180 percent year over year and 64 percent quarter over quarter again well ahead of expectations. The core driver was explosive AI driven memory demand. HBM led the upside with capacity already sold out and management significantly raising its outlook for the future HBM market showing demand is far stronger than previously expected. At the same time traditional DRAM and NAND also benefited from AI spillover demand and tight supply leading to both volume and price increases and pushing overall margins to new highs. An aggressive next quarter guide further reinforced confidence that the memory industry is entering a new upcycle. Overall the report confirms that AI is lifting not just high end memory but the entire storage stack though with strong growth and elevated valuations options setups look less attractive for buyers right now.  \nAt this point should I continue holding add more or take profits really curious to hear what everyone thinks!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORT**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-18 11:32:03 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: CAUTIOUSLY BEARISH WITH SPECULATIVE POCKETS**\nThe overall sentiment is **Bearish-to-Neutral**, characterized by:\n*   **Retail Frustration & Skepticism:** Reddit sentiment shows high disillusionment (\"exit liquidity,\" \"rate my bags,\" questioning CPI data). This indicates a fatigued, skeptical retail base, a potential contrarian signal if extreme.\n*   **Macro Pressure:** Elevated 10Y Treasury Yield (4.15%) and Fed Funds Rate (3.64%) suggest a still-restrictive monetary environment, pressuring equity valuations. The high national debt discussion underscores structural concerns.\n*   **VIX Level:** At 17.62, the VIX indicates **elevated anxiety**, not panic, but above complacent levels (<15).\n*   **Contrasting Signal:** The sharp drop in inflation (CPI down to 2.7%) is a **bullish macro catalyst**, but market reaction appears muted or skeptical, as seen in Reddit's CPI data distrust.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES**\n*   **Inflation & Fed Policy Disconnect:** The confirmed drop in CPI (2.7%) is the dominant macro data point. However, a clear theme of **distrust in official data** (Reddit) contrasts with institutional analysis (Bloomberg's \"Another Big Shift in AI Vibes\" may relate to growth/inflation recalibration).\n*   **AI & Tech Re-evaluation:** NVIDIA's sharp decline and the \"AI Infrastructure\" bag-holding discussion signal a **maturation/correction phase** in the AI trade. The euphoria is being replaced by scrutiny of valuations and real profitability.\n*   **Political & Regulatory Catalysts:** Trump-related topics (tariffs, DJT merger) are significant retail sentiment drivers. The Citi penalty shed shows ongoing regulatory resolution.\n*   **Speculative Mania & Volatility:** The massive, nonsensical notional values discussed for UK GME, the DJT merger spike (+25%), and the \"gamma nightmare\" debate point to **continued pockets of extreme retail-driven volatility** in meme/SPAC-like structures.\n*   **Credit & Fixed Income Focus:** Institutional news highlights munis, catastrophe bonds, and corporate deals (Nexi, LNG), indicating a **search for yield and credit opportunities** in a higher-rate environment.\n\n### **3. IMPORTANT MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Primary Catalyst (Confirmed):** **DECEMBER CPI PRINT OF 2.7%.** This is the most important data point, moving inflation closer to the Fed's target. It strengthens the case for imminent rate cuts.\n*   **Secondary Catalyst (Evolving):** **AI Trade Unwind.** NVDA's >20% drop is a leading indicator. This is a major sector rotation signal.\n*   **Sentiment Signal:** Retail is **capitulating on former high-conviction themes** (AI, meme stocks). This is often a late-stage bearish signal.\n*   **Liquidity Signal:** Fed Funds at 3.64% with falling inflation creates a powerful narrative for **impending liquidity injection** (rate cuts), which is a forward-looking bullish underpinning.\n*   **Risk Signal:** The surge in obscure, low-priced stocks (VIVK +40.59%, UGRO +24.12%) alongside broad skepticism suggests capital is **chasing highly speculative, non-index correlated plays**—a sign of frustrated risk appetite.\n\n### **4. PRIMARY RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES**\n*   **Risks:**\n    1.  **Growth Shock:** The AI sell-off could broaden into a wider tech/growth rout, especially if earnings fail to justify still-high valuations.\n    2.  **Sentiment Trap:** Retail distrust and apathy could deepen, reducing market breadth and amplifying downside moves on any negative news.\n    3.  **Political Volatility:** Tariff talk and election-related policies (Trump Media merger) inject unpredictable geopolitical risk.\n    4.  **Credit Event:** High interest payments on national/corporate debt (per CRFB) remain a systemic, slow-burn risk.\n*   **Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Rate-Sensitive Rotation:** Falling CPI directly benefits **rate-sensitive sectors** (Utilities, Real Estate) and **long-duration assets** (growth stocks, bonds).\n    2.  **Contrarian Tech Entry:** A disciplined, valuation-focused entry into **high-quality AI/tech names** post-correction (like NVDA) may emerge.\n    3.  **Fixed Income Revival:** Municipal bonds (\"Munis Set to Reap Cash\") and Treasuries become more attractive as the Fed pivot nears.\n    4.  **Volatility Harvesting:** Elevated VIX and episodic meme stock mania (DJT) present opportunities for **structured options strategies**.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**WATCH/ACTIONS:**\n\n*   **SECTOR: Fixed Income / Rate Sensitives** - Begin scaling into high-quality **intermediate duration Treasuries (IEI, IEF)** and **Municipal Bond ETFs (MUB)**. The macro shift towards rate cuts is now data-confirmed.\n*   **SECTOR: Technology (Selective)** - Avoid broad tech ETFs. Instead, **watch for basing patterns in mega-cap tech (MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA)**. Deploy capital only on significant further weakness or clear reversal confirmation. Favor companies with robust FCF over pure AI narrative.\n*   **SYMBOL: VIX / VIXY** - Maintain a small hedge. While CPI is bullish, retail skepticism and geopolitical noise suggest **volatility will remain sticky above 15**. Consider long-vol positions on any VIX dip near 16.\n*   **SYMBOL: DJT / Meme ETFs (MEME)** - **Treat as pure casino exposure only.** The +25% spike on merger news is a liquidity event, not an investment thesis. Any long position must be sized as speculative and have a tight stop-loss.\n*   **MACRO: Fed Funds Futures** - **Monitor the probability and timing of the first 2026 rate cut.** This will be the next major driver of market multiple expansion. A move towards a March 2026 cut will be aggressively bullish.\n*   **RISK: Market Breadth** - Watch advance/decline ratios. If the market rallies on falling rates but breadth remains poor (i.e., only megacaps rise), it signals a weak rally. **Prefer broad-based participation (IWM, SPHB)** for conviction in a new uptrend.\n\n---\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market is in a **transition phase** from an inflation-fighting regime to a growth-supportive one. The key CPI data is bullish, but sentiment is lagging due to recent pain. The immediate play is a rotation into rate-sensitive assets while selectively preparing for a potential re-entry into corrected growth. **Patience and selectivity are paramount;** avoid chasing low-quality speculative spikes.",

      "content": "Commerce to open up exports of Nvidia H200 chips to China\n\nSeeking a compromise over controlling exports to China, the US Department of Commerce will soon allow the export of powerful Nvidia GPUs that are roughly 18 months behind its most advanced offerings, according to a person with knowledge of the plan.\n\nThe move, which would send Nvidia H200s to China, seeks to find a middle ground between those who oppose exports of any advanced AI chips and those who worry that restrictions will merely hand the market to Chinese competitors. It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government, which has blocked imports of less powerful chips, such as Nvidia’s H20.\n\nThe move, which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, could bolster Nvidia’s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide.\n\nThe US enacted strict export restrictions under the Biden Administration in an effort to prevent China from catching up on AI. But some in the White House believe those restrictions have more or less failed, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n    \n[Source](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/08/2025/commerce-to-open-up-exports-of-nvidia-h200-chips-to-china)",

      "content": "Carvana $CVNA is Highly Fraudulent\n\nCredentials:  14 year automotive veteran.  15 year options trader\n\nBullet Points:\n\n1) Carvana’s profit margins are too good to be true.  The best companies in the industry don’t come close to their 19% gross profit margins.  \n\n2) The CEO of Carvana (Ernest Garcia III) Also owns a privately owned auto business named Drivetime.  Drivetime is a dumpster fire.\n\n3) Ernest Garcia III has been funneling his unwanted Carvana inventory to Drivetime to prop up Carvana’s earnings.  Drivetime overpays Carvana for this inventory and then takes the loss on their own balance sheets.\n\n4) Over the last few months Ernest Garcia III has been selling tens of millions of dollars of stock to keep Drivetime afloat\n\n5) Carvana has issued roughly 15.3 million shares over the last year.  At average $330 price this comes to roughly 5 Billion USD.  None of this reflects on the company’s financial report.  \n\nThesis:\n\nBased on CVNA October 2025 earnings report the company’s equity attributed to shareholders increased by 1B usd.\n\nIn the same period the company issued ~15.3 million shares worth over 5B usd.  None of this issuance reflects on the company’s balance sheets.  Healthy companies issue dividends and buy back stock.  Carvana has no dividend and has issued billions in stock solely to their core insiders.\n\nDrivetime (a company owned by Carvana’s CEO) has the worst inventory I have ever seen.  Thousands and thousands of cars that are absolutely overpriced garbage.  Some of the cars they have been sitting on for over 6 months.  \n\nIn October and September of 2025 Ernest Garcia III has sold roughly 82 million dollars of carvana stock.  \n\nI am not a private investigator, financial pro, or accountant, but to me the evidence is compelling that carvana’s results are being directly propped by DRIVETIME and once the Garcias have enriched themselves the real results will emerge.\n\nI plan to open short positions against CVNA in the next few weeks after they fully transition to the SP 500",

Waymo is one of the largest positions in Tiger’s 2024 fund.\n\nWaymo declined to comment.\n\nThis year, Waymo has also announced a slew of expansions, including its debut on freeways in three cities, and autonomous driving in cities including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando.\n\nThe latest milestone is also another sign that Waymo is continuing to push ahead of aspiring self-driving competitor Tesla, which has run limited pilots in Austin and operates a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area.\n\nTesla vehicles include human drivers or safety supervisors on board and are not driverless like Waymo’s fleet vehicles.\n\nAccording to Tesla’s latest earnings call, executives said the company hit a quarter of a million miles with its fleet in Austin, and more than one million in the Bay Area. In July, Waymo announced 100 million total fully autonomous miles.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html)",

The arrests are part of a wider investigation into what officials say is a network designed to bypass U.S. export controls on advanced technology. Separately, a Houston-based company and its owner have already pleaded guilty to routing Nvidia hardware through shell buyers to evade restrictions. Investigators say the broader probe now involves more than $160 million worth of export-controlled tech. It’s another reminder of how tight controls around AI and high-end chips have become, and how aggressively enforcement is picking up as demand keeps rising.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/us-attorneys-office-southern-district-of-texas-prosecutors-nvidia-chips-h200-h100-smuggle-china.html?__source=androidappshare",

      "content": "Michael Saylor just pitched countries on creating Bitcoin backed digital banking systems and the concept is pretty wild.\n\nSpeaking in Abu Dhabi, Saylor laid out a vision where countries could use Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit to offer regulated bank accounts that give way higher returns than traditional deposits. He pointed out that banks in Japan, Europe and Switzerland barely pay any interest while US money market funds are around 4%. People are basically disgusted with their bank accounts which is why corporate bonds exist.\n\nHis proposal involves structuring accounts with about 80% digital credit instruments, 20% regular currency, and an extra 10% buffer to reduce volatility. The digital credit layer would be backed by Bitcoin reserves with about 5 to 1 overcollateralization. Basically using Bitcoin as the ultimate collateral layer.\n\nSaylor thinks a country that implements this could attract $20 to $50 trillion in deposits and become the digital banking capital of the world. Thats not a small claim.\n\nHowever theres obvious skepticism here. Bitcoin is down 28% from its recent highs and dropped 9% over the past year. The volatility makes people question how you can build stable high yield products on top of it. One former bond trader called Saylors moves folly and said hiking rates to maintain a peg wont work when people want their money back during a panic.\n\nStrategy already has a product called STRC that works somewhat like this - its grown to $2.9 billion but faces doubts about whether it can handle a real liquidity crunch.\n\nThe idea is innovative but feels like it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating long term to actually work. What happens during extended bear markets?",

It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government, which has blocked imports of less powerful chips, such as Nvidia’s H20.\n\nThe move, which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, could bolster Nvidia’s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide.\n    \n[Source](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/08/2025/commerce-to-open-up-exports-of-nvidia-h200-chips-to-china)",

With the missing October data, and the compromised November data, I actually think they might opt to hold rates steady until they have a more complete data set in January. From their point of view there is no harm in waiting; one month won't make a big difference in the long term. Looking at the most recent reports, the data doesnt seem to support the notion that inflation is coming down or that joblessness is much worse than it was earlier this year--look at the charts. I'm sure a lot of you want to tell me that the job market is trash, and I agree, but it's not in the data. And we definitely can't be certain that tariffs are gone for good. I'm preparing for a bloodbath this Wednesday, maybe even the beginning of the AI crash. ",

My allocation is 70/20/10 which feels right but the mental clarity from simplifying was honestly the best part, I don't spend hours reading earnings or arguing online anymore, I check everything with blossom now and my returns have been totally fine, just buying more shares monthly and ignoring the noise, nothing crazy but steady…\n\nIf you're on the fence about going full bogle I'd say just do it, the peace of mind is worth more than chasing extra returns",

      "content": "Tomorrow's Fed Meeting - Where Will Nasdaq Go?\nNasdaq closed at 23,545 today, down 0.14%, just sitting there waiting for tomorrow's 2 PM Fed verdict.\n\nA 25 basis point cut is basically locked in - 90% probability. But the key question is **what happens next year**.\n\nPowell's term ends in May next year, and Trump has already picked his successor (likely Kevin Hassett, White House National Economic Council Director, super dovish). Market rumors say it could be announced before Christmas.\n\n**Two variables for next year:**\n\n1. **New chair will be more dovish** \\- Hassett wrote \"Dow 36,000,\" advocates for quick rate cuts and tax cuts, absolutely bullish for stocks. 1-2 cuts next year should be solid.\n2. **Tariff situation is settled** \\- Trump's tariff policy is basically done negotiating, deals are signed, exemptions granted. Although some furniture and lumber tariffs will increase next year, overall it won't spike like it did in April. Supreme Court is reviewing tariff legality, but even if overturned, Trump has other legal tools available, minimal impact.\n\n**What about tomorrow?**\n\nFutures are already up 0.4%, likely opening with a small gain of 0.2-0.5%. Real direction depends on Powell's 2:30 PM press conference. If he's optimistic about next year, Nasdaq pushes to 23,700-24,000. If he's still worried about inflation, might pullback to 23,300.\n\n**What about 2026?**\n\nWall Street predicts Nasdaq up 15-25% next year, targeting 27,000-30,000. Logic: AI continues burning cash, tech earnings grow 15-20%, new chair more dovish, tariffs won't get worse.\n\nBottom line - next year's hand is actually pretty good. Powell's out, someone who loves cutting rates comes in; tariff war's over, no more chaos. Nasdaq's up 22% this year, another run next year isn't impossible.",

The decision partially rolls back restrictions that had previously barred shipments of Nvidia’s A100, H100, and H200-class GPUs to Chinese customers over national security concerns.\n\nUnder the revised rules, Nvidia may resume sales of the H200 so long as exported configurations fall within newly defined performance limits and comply with enhanced government monitoring. The adjustment follows weeks of uncertainty, during which Nvidia executives repeatedly emphasized that final export approval would ultimately come from President Trump.\n\nChina represents 20 to 25% of Nvidia’s data-center revenue. Restoring access even partially could meaningfully lift 2026 sales guidance.",

      "content": "271 percent YoY growth in one month is not typical for an energy company\n\nMost people skim revenue press releases and move on. This one deserves a second look.\n\nNXXT just reported preliminary November revenue of **7.51 million dollars**, up from **2.02 million dollars** a year ago.  \nThat’s **271 percent year-over-year expansion** for a company that builds real infrastructure, not software subscriptions.\n\nYear-to-date revenue now stands at about **73.5 million dollars**, which means they will close 2025 at the highest level in company history. What stands out is how they achieved it. November didn’t spike because of a one-time event  it came from steady execution plus a new long-term PPA that adds stability going forward.\n\nThe company is starting to operate like a hybrid: part traditional energy operator, part microgrid developer, part AI-powered optimization platform. The release also mentioned progress in solar-plus-battery integration and their **RENCAST predictive analytics** system, which forecasts workloads and power prices while optimizing battery cycles.\n\nYou don’t grow 271 percent year-over-year in November unless demand is genuine. Healthcare, commercial facilities and critical sites don’t sign PPAs unless the tech performs. This is the kind of revenue curve that usually marks the transition from “early-stage” to delivery.",

And what is great for the world? To end the dependence on USA and Nvidia for GPUs. And make long term contracts for supply of AI chips from diverse sources, including Google TPUs, and Chinese AI chips. Chinese will eventually catch up with USA in AI chips. Huawei, Baidu, and Cambricorn are the local suppliers. Private Chinese companies are still reliant on Nvidia, but with the right government policies, that will be over by 2030. \n\nAnd India needs startup and big tech funding to develop its own AI chip design and manufacturing industry. With support from the government and domestic and international venture capital, they should have AI independence within a decade.\n\nReference: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/08/trump-nvidia-ai-chips-china",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Date:** 2025-12-09 | **Time Horizon:** Day | **Sentiment:** **Cautiously Bullish with High Event Risk**\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Cautiously Bullish, Fed-Dependent**\nThe sentiment is bifurcated. **Retail sentiment (Reddit)** is overtly bullish, dominated by mega-cap tech bets (NVDA, NFLX), meme stock chatter (GME, CVNA), and large YOLO-style index calls (SPY). This indicates high risk appetite and speculative froth among retail traders. However, **institutional/news sentiment (RSS)** is in a holding pattern, with the S&P 500 \"wavering\" as professional traders await the **Fed decision and Oracle earnings**. The elevated VIX (16.66) confirms underlying anxiety. The overall tone is bullish but fragile, entirely contingent on the upcoming macro catalyst.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES: Across All Sources**\n*   **AI & Geopolitical Tech Policy:** The dominant theme. **Nvidia's H200 chip sales to China** are a major headline, repeated across Reddit and Bloomberg. This is a direct catalyst for the semiconductor/AI sector, seen as a positive for NVDA and peers.\n*   **Mega-Merger Mania:** **Paramount's hostile cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery** is a top story in both Reddit and financial news, signaling potential volatility and arbitrage opportunities in the media sector.\n*   **Federal Reserve Focus:** The market is in a **pre-Fed pause**. All action is sidelined ahead of Wednesday's decision, with news highlighting \"year-end funding strains\" and what to expect.\n*   **Retail Speculation & Meme Dynamics:** Reddit shows a resurgence of meme stock culture (GME, CVNA fraud allegations) and large, confident single-stock positions (NFLX, SPY YOLO). This is a contrarian risk indicator.\n*   **Economic Data Ambiguity:** The delayed October PPI report (noted on Reddit) and the discussion of a thriving market despite a \"dragging\" economy point to a focus on data reliability and the disconnect between Main Street and Wall Street.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (Wed):** **FOMC Rate Decision & Projections.** This will dictate near-term direction. Any hawkish surprise could sharply reverse the current retail-driven bullishness.\n*   **Key Earnings Catalyst:** **Oracle (ORCL)** earnings, mentioned by Bloomberg, will be a bellwether for enterprise AI and cloud spending.\n*   **Sector-Specific Catalyst:** The **U.S. approval of NVDA H200 exports to China** is a clear positive signal for the semiconductor supply chain and AI ecosystem.\n*   **Contrarian Signal:** Extreme retail bullishness and large, public index bets (\"30K SPY YOLO\") often coincide with short-term market tops or increased volatility.\n*   **Technical Signal:** The 10-Year Treasury Yield at **4.14%** remains elevated, maintaining pressure on equity valuations. The market is climbing a wall of worry.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Fed Hawkish Shock:** The largest near-term risk. If the Fed signals slower cuts or concern over recent data, it could trigger a broad sell-off.\n    2.  **Retail Overextension:** The concentration of retail interest in a few mega-cap tech and meme names increases vulnerability to a sharp, sentiment-driven correction.\n    3.  **Event Volatility:** The Paramount-WBD hostile bid could cause sharp moves in both stocks and related media/sentiment proxies.\n    4.  **Data Integrity Concerns:** The delay of the PPI report may foster distrust in economic data, leading to unpredictable reactions to future releases.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Policy-Driven Tech Rally:** A dovish Fed *combined* with the China chip approval could fuel a powerful rally in semiconductors (SOXX) and AI-related names.\n    2.  **Merger Arbitrage:** The media M&A activity presents defined-event trading opportunities.\n    3.  **Post-Fed Clarity Play:** Once the Fed communicates its stance, a high-probability directional trade in indices (SPY/QQQ) or rate-sensitive sectors (financials, utilities) will emerge.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n*   **PRE-FED (Today - Tuesday):**\n    *   **SECTOR: Semiconductors/AI** - Maintain core positions but avoid new aggressive buys. The China news is priced in for now. Wait for the Fed's tone to confirm the trend.\n    *   **SYMBOL: NVDA** - Monitor for a breakout above $185 on heavy volume post-Fed as a confirmation of the bullish thesis. Support at $180 is key.\n    *   **ACTION: Reduce Portfolio Beta** - Hedge long portfolios with modest VIX calls or put spreads on indices ahead of the Fed announcement. **Do not chase retail YOLO momentum.**\n\n*   **POST-FED (Wednesday Onward):**\n    *   **SCENARIO 1 (Dovish/Fed Pivot Hint):**\n        *   **SYMBOL: SOXL/SOXS** - Favor long semiconductor exposure (SOXL). Also consider **XLF** (financials) for a relief rally.\n        *   **SYMBOL: ORCL** - A strong earnings report post-Fed could be a major accelerant for tech.\n    *   **SCENARIO 2 (Hawkish/Inflation Worry):**\n        *   **SYMBOL: VIX** - Direct long volatility play.\n        *   **SECTOR: Minimum Volatility/Defensives** - Rotate towards utilities (XLU) and consumer staples (XLP).\n        *   **SYMBOL: TLT** - A hawkish shock could initially spike yields, creating a potential buy-the-dip moment in long-duration treasuries if a \"hard landing\" fear resurfaces.\n\n*   **SPECIFIC SITUATIONS:**\n    *   **SYMBOL: WBD/PARA** - For experienced traders only. Monitor arbitrage spreads on the hostile bid. Expect extreme volatility.\n    *   **SYMBOL: CVNA, GME** - Treat as pure sentiment indicators, not investments. Their strength is a *contrarian warning signal* for overall market risk appetite.\n    *   **MACRO: Gold (GLD)** - Watch for a move above $388 if the Fed is perceived as weak on inflation, or if real yields fall.\n\n**Bottom Line:** The market is on pause, awaiting instructions from the Fed. Retail is all-in, but smart money is waiting. **The plan today is defense and preparation; the opportunity comes Wednesday afternoon.** Position sizing and risk management are paramount.",

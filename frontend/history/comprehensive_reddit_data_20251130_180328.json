      "content": "Seasonal hiring down 25% from last year as layoffs rise and retailers stay cautious amid weak consumer spending\n\nNote: \"Weak consumer spending\" refers to store expectations before the season started. Consumer spending ended up being high which is why Black Friday set a new record\n\nNo paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seasonal-hiring-offers-little-reprieve-for-labor-market-woes-110044972.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seasonal-hiring-offers-little-reprieve-for-labor-market-woes-110044972.html)\n\n&gt;Plenty of Americans are expected to pour into stores and fill online carts this holiday shopping season. Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza.\n\n&gt;As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up, the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year, with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade.\n\n&gt;Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012.\n\n&gt;The National Retail Federation, a trade group, also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season, plans to bring on extra staff could be at “the lowest level in more than 15 years.” Retailers were expected to bring on 265,000 to 365,000 seasonal workers, compared to 442,000 in 2024.\n\n&gt;Interest in seasonal work, though, remains plenty high — up 27% at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board, according to Cory Stahle, a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab.\n\n&gt;Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7% from a year ago, and still below pre-pandemic levels. (Indeed’s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall, such as in accounting and ski resorts, rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail, Stahle said.)\n\n&gt;“I think it’s very telling that we’re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago,” Stahle said. “There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall.”\n\n&gt;Retail especially has “just really pulled back,” he said.\n\n&gt;The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119,000 positions that month, though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts. The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare, food services and drinking places, and social assistance, and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior.\n\n&gt;Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans. Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year.\n\n&gt;A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach, saying, “For the past few years, we’ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates. It’s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive.”\n\n&gt;Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year, some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a K-shaped economy. A recent survey of 1,048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America’s Future found that 68% of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year, while 59% anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year. Just 5% of respondents were actively hiring or expanding, while 16% were scaling back, the survey found.\n\n&gt;Read more: What is a 'K-shaped economy,' and what's causing the divide?\n\n&gt;The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending.\n\n&gt;Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring.\n\n&gt;“Employers aren’t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through, or to the degree in which people are going to spend, and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing,” Stahle said.",

      "content": "Are We Already in the GME Endgame?\n\nIt’s 30 November 2025. We’re about to enter 2026, almost five years after… well, you know what.\n\nWe’re at the point where a lot of people are thinking: “It has to happen soon, right?” My view: we’re not just waiting for the turnaround anymore, we’re already in it. The market just hasn’t fully reacted yet.\n\nPowerPacks are, in my opinion, the early visible part of that turnaround. If they execute, this can become a serious money-making machine. Right now it’s “just” PowerPacks, but I see this as one piece of a much bigger digital collectibles ecosystem that GME is quietly building. First you build the rails and the infrastructure, then you start scaling the use cases on top of it.\n\nAt some point, that shows up in the numbers. Earnings will start reflecting that something is changing under the hood. And when the market finally looks up from its spreadsheets and realizes, “Wait a minute… this is actually going somewhere,” sentiment can flip much faster than people expect. I think this upcoming earnings report has the potential to be a psychological turning point more than anything else.\n\nNow, about Burry.\n\nThere’s a lot of confusion about what his actual goal is. Is he just marketing his Substack? Trying to funnel apes into paid subscriptions? Or is he preparing to drop something genuinely spicy?\n\nThe latest thing he said: “And I have an idea for what GME should do now”, is very interesting wording. He’s not just commenting from the sidelines; he’s explicitly saying he has advice for GME. That’s not something you do for no reason. Last time he publicly got this involved, he had a position in the company. Historically, he doesn’t waste energy on things he thinks are irrelevant.\n\nCombine that with Kitty’s memes over the past years. When you rewatch them with the current info in mind, there are multiple references to “others,” to it being part of a larger plan, to there being more players involved than just one guy posting cat videos on Twitter. It always felt like he was hinting that he wasn’t alone, that there were more of them behind the scenes.\n\nSo here’s where I’m at:\n\n– GME is laying the groundwork for a broader digital collectibles / digital ownership ecosystem, with PowerPacks as an early monetizable piece.  \n– The fundamentals of that strategy don’t instantly show up in price, but they do start showing up in earnings and narrative.  \n– Burry re-entering the conversation right now, with “I have an idea for what GME should do now,” doesn’t feel random.  \n– Kitty’s older memes look a lot more interesting in hindsight if you assume there was always more than one “player” in this story.\n\nMaybe I’m wrong. Maybe it’s all just marketing and noise.\n\nBut if the “it’s not over” hints were real, and if multiple big brains have been aligned behind the scenes for years, then we might not be waiting for the start of the endgame.\n\nWe might already be in it.\n\n(Not financial advice. I’m just an ape connecting dots.)",

I’m not making predictions or anything, just trying to understand the market side of it.\n\nVenezuela doesn’t export like it used to but they still sit on a massive amount of oil, so even a hint of military escalation usually freaks out the oil futures guys. Would be weird because the US only recently relaxed sanctions a bit, so if Trump goes full “we’re doing something big” again, that probably means oil jumps, energy stocks breathe for a bit, and airlines get punched in the face like usual.\n\nI’m wondering more about the broader market though. If it’s just a one-off strike, markets probably dip early then go back to normal (like they always do). But if it drags out or turns into some long political mess, then I can see VIX spiking, EM getting slapped, gold doing its “I’m useful again” thing, and everyone pretending they predicted it.\n\nTrump also flip-flops so much that it’s hard to take any of this seriously until something actually moves, but still… how are people thinking about the actual market reaction if this doesn’t just fade in a day?\n\nNot looking for political takes, just the market angle.\n\n",

He said he was buying them every day, especially if they went down, valuations were old fashioned... they were guaranteed 10-20x.\n\n# Jim Cramer's 'only 10 stocks to own for the future'\n\n1. **724 Solutions**\n2. **Ariba**\n3. **Digital Island**\n4. **Exodus Communications**\n5. **InfoSpace**\n6. **Inktomi**\n7. **Mercury Interactive**\n8. **Sonera**\n9. **VeriSign**\n10. **Veritas Software**\n\nCramer's choices were soon mostly destroyed too fast to get out whole. By contrast, the same initial $100,000 in a passive S&amp;P 500 index investment would be worth **\\~$712,600** today.\n\nThis is how taking Jim Cramer's recommendations made me work 10 extra years before I could retire (not hypothetical... true story).  I'm just sharing my story because I see posts in this channel looking for 'guaranteed 10x' and I still see Cramer fanboys... IMHO anyone can pick winners when the whole market is going up... the true challenge is who can predict success over time. Someone will say 'VeriSign' is/was great... but that was insufficient to make up for the 90% bad choices and resulted in a 50% loss over 25 years vs 700% gain if you ignored him and listened to Boggle. Young people may not think this is a big deal... but trust me... when you are old... having to work 10 more years is painful.",

Comments from the Fed member about rate-cut boosted the stock market. This week was completely shaped around those remaks and several major banks outlooks of 2026 stock markets.\n\n📊 Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,\n\nOctober 31 close at 6,840.20 - November 7 close at 6,728.81 🔴 (-1.63%)\n\nNovember 7 close at 6,728.81 - November 14 close at 6,734.11 🟢 (+0.08%)\n\nNovember 14 close at 6,734.11 - November 21 close at 6,602.96 🔴 (-1.95%)\n\nNovember 21 close at 6,602.96 - November 28 close at 6,849.09 🟢 (3.73%)\n\n🔸 Monday: Last Friday, the stock market closed strongly and gained more than 1%.

I've read the estimated loss is from 13 to 18 billion annually. The likelihood of this happening is High. So let's assume the higher end 18B. \n\nThey are going through efficiency changes and trying to cut 7B until 2027 annualy on costs. Likelihood of this is moderate. They did go through bunch of acquisitions I believe there are somewhat clear ways to find efficiency. \n\nAcquired companies are meant to replace the lost revenue with new products. Estimates for those are all over the place from 10B to 35B. Depending on how actively analysts are trying to sell their book. But the general consensus is that company did buy some really promising oncology treatment drugs and maybe they can get some portion of the market share of weight loss drugs. I mean there must be a reason Novo were also bidding for Metsera acquisition, right? \n\nIf we go with 25B of revenue gain from new products, we're looking at 69.5B in revenue by 2030 - CAGR 2.5%. Not impressive and has an execution risk. But combined with 7B cost cutting initiative. It is actually enough to re rate stock to a higher PE value, simply because it is trading so low. \n\nI'd rate it as a hold. I really wanted to buy it for 7% yield at such a low valuation and optionality of a re rating, but for me it is not worth the risk. The pipeline is too vast for me to digest in one week. Maybe I'll read more and find conviction. ",

Today it is about $22 trillion.\nInflation adjusted (22/1.03^26), this is about $10 trillion in 1999 dollars, so we have a 2.3x greater money supply today than we did in 1999, inflation adjusted.\n\nI wonder - does this mean our valuations would also translate roughly 2.3x higher? Hence, if the p/e was about 30 in 1999, with 2.3x the money supply, would an equivalent “bubble” p/e be 2.3x30=69?\n\nIf so, maybe it’s different this time… ;) just kidding. But I do feel like the M2 could have some impact on juicing values and therefore raising the “bubble” threshold. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

      "content": "Nuclear and utilities, silver and platinum\n\nPhysics graduate here. Father who worked in banking. Not investing advice.\n\nSilver and platinum are essential for satellites and in semiconductors. They are used because of their electrical/thermal properties. Silver has the *highest* electrical conductivity of any element... it's used in conductive pastes, die attach materials etc etc. Platinum is relevant to some catalytic processes in fab equipment. Plus the broader supply chain for electronics (PCBs, connectors, sensors, relays, circuit breakers, membrane keypads should I got on? ) all need these metals. Data-centers arent just chips floating in a void (they need to \"transform\"/\"bridge\" the energy)....they need both silver and platinum.\n\nEveryone's chasing NVDA and the AI hype (rightfully so imo) but I think people are sleeping on what actually makes all this possible... (energy and the non-renewable components)\n\nA single H100 pulls about 700W. These data centers are absolute power hogs and its only going to get worse as models get bigger and inference demand scales up. Microsoft, Google, Amazon... they're all scrambling to lock down power contracts right now. This isn't speculation, you can look up the deals they're signing.\n\nThe thing is you can't run AI on solar and wind alone (and unfortunately neither on my favorite form -- hydro). You need baseload power that runs 24/7 regardless of weather. Nuclear is basically the only clean option that fits the bill. And the big tech companies know this which is why we're seeing all these nuclear deals suddenly. Three Mile Island is getting restarted. Google signed with Kairos for SMRs. Microsoft is literally posting job listings for nuclear engineers.\n\nMore reactors are being built now than we've seen in decades (in Germany the government wants to build \"mini nuclear-power plants\".\n\nThe regulatory environment is slowly shifting because everyone realized we kinda need this stuff. NuScale got their SMR design approved. There's actual momentum here for the first time in forever.\n\nUtilities in general are having a moment too. Rate base growth from all this new demand, allowed returns going up in some states. Its not sexy but the math works.\n\nSilver and platinum are highly priced but I will buy the dip. Utilities and nuclear indirectly help AI and EV's. Energy is always needed in one way or another, it's hard for a new company to join (high barriers to entry).\n\nNot saying go all in obviously. Just saying the AI trade is bigger than chips. The whole stack matters.",

      "content": "How should I deal with it?\n\nI recently started a small clothing business. The idea is: I source vintage items from Japan and ship them back to Vietnam, where my friend helps receive the packages and handle local shipping. His role is basically picking which items to import and coordinating deliveries. We’ve only been running this for three days, but the early numbers look pretty promising.\n\nThe problem started when his close friend (they’ve known each other since middle school) suddenly decided to copy the exact same business model I’m doing. Then he invited my partner to join his new business.\n\nAt first, that guy also asked me to team up with them, but I refused because he has a history of running away from debt and being involved in messy situations. I didn’t want to get tied up with someone like that.\n\nAfter I declined, my current partner’s attitude changed. He told me he “wants to talk about salary” and then said he’s been busy with school lately and wants to “focus on studying more.” It felt like he was slowly distancing himself after his friend offered him something.\n\nI’m just starting this business and already running into this kind of situation. How should I deal with it?\n. ",

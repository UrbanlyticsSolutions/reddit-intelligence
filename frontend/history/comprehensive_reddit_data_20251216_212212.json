      "content": "U.S. crude oil drops below $55 a barrel, hits lowest level since early 2021\n\nOil has been under steady pressure this year, and it doesn’t seem to be coming from just one factor. OPEC+ has been adding supply back into the market faster than many expected after years of disciplined output cuts, and that extra production is starting to show up in inventories and price action. At the same time, the geopolitical risk premium that supported crude over the past couple of years is slowly deflating. Markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, or at least a less volatile outlook, which reduces fears around supply disruptions tied to the conflict.\nPut together, it’s a tough setup for oil bulls: more barrels coming online while the “fear bid” fades. Demand hasn’t collapsed, but it hasn’t been strong enough to absorb the new supply without pressure on prices. Curious how others are thinking about this is this just a cyclical oversupply phase, or does it mark a longer period of capped oil prices if geopolitics cool and OPEC+ prioritizes volume over price?\n\n Source :\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/crude-oil-prices-today.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

Assuming Tesla car sales will also be impacted *(+ remaining headwind from the political turnoil earlier this year + Chinese EV competition in China and Europe)*, Tesla may go from unreasonable P/E to negative earnings. While last quarter was somewhat salvaged by the last minute demand to get in on the US EV credit, this won't be happening in Q4.\n\nWhile this doesn't necessarily change the long term picture *(whether you buy AV + robots thesis or not)*, I do think this will spook investors quite a bit and force a reality check.",

      "content": "Tesla stock hits record as Wall Street rallies around robotaxi hype despite slow EV sales\n\nTesla’s stock just set a new record, breaking past its previous all-time high from almost exactly a year ago. The rally comes after a wild 12 months for shareholders including a brutal 36% drop in Q1, the stock’s worst quarterly performance since 2022. What’s driving the rebound now seems to be renewed optimism around Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi vision. Investors appear to be betting that Tesla can finally convert its existing fleet of EVs into autonomous, revenue-generating vehicles, rather than treating autonomy as a distant concept. Still, it’s hard to ignore how quickly sentiment has flipped. From heavy losses early in the year to record highs now, Tesla remains one of the most emotion-driven names in the market.\nDo you see this move as confidence in real progress on autonomy, or just another sentiment-driven Tesla cycle?\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/tesla-stock-hits-record-on-robotaxi-hype-despite-drop-in-ev-sales.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "content": "TSLA's epic surge: With its core business collapsing, why did its stock price reach a new all-time high of $491.5?\n\nTSLA surged against the market trend today, reaching a new all-time high of $491.5, while Elon Musk's net worth soared to over $670 billion.  This stands in stark contrast to the company's core business struggles, including a nearly 40% drop in European sales and institutional forecasts of declining Q4 deliveries. The truth is: Wall Street has completely abandoned fundamental analysis of TSLA's automotive business. They are making a massive gamble that Musk will successfully transform into the core of an AI empire $1.6 trillion market capitalization is just the beginning. What they truly value is the $1 trillion profit potential of the FSD software, the multi-trillion-dollar market for CyberCab and Optimus robots by 2026, and the epic narrative of the SpaceX space economy behind it all. This high-risk gamble, which completely ties personal wealth, grand narratives, and extreme valuations together, means that TSLA is a bet that will either reach $3 trillion or see its dreams shattered.\n\nAt this point, would you buy at a high price, or would you wait and see?",

At this point, it’s the only player running large-scale, fully driverless commercial services in multiple cities, which gives it a meaningful real-world data advantage. Amazon’s Zoox is taking a different approach, starting with limited public access. It’s begun offering free driverless rides around parts of the Las Vegas Strip and select San Francisco neighborhoods, signaling confidence in its tech but still moving cautiously. Tesla has entered the conversation with a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the Bay Area, but as of mid-December those vehicles still rely on human drivers or safety supervisors. That puts Tesla more in a pilot phase than true autonomy for now.\nOverall, the gap between “driverless demos” and fully autonomous, scaled operations is becoming clearer. Waymo looks firmly in front today, while Zoox and Tesla are progressing just on very different timelines and risk profiles.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/waymo-amazon-zoox-tesla-robotaxi-expansion.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

Why some on Wall Street say that’s a bad idea\n\nNasdaq says it plans to file with the SEC to allow U.S. stocks and ETFs to trade almost around the clock, five days a week, starting as early as the second half of 2026. The proposal would stretch trading to 23 hours per weekday, splitting the market into a long “day session” (4 a.m.–8 p.m. ET), a one-hour pause, and an overnight session (9 p.m.–4 a.m.). Supporters argue this just formalizes what already exists in crypto and futures, and better serves global investors who don’t operate on U.S. time zones. Critics aren’t convinced. Concerns center on thinner liquidity during overnight hours, bigger price swings, and whether constant trading would amplify short-term speculation rather than improve price discovery.\nCurious how others see this. Is nearly nonstop equity trading the natural next step, or does it risk creating more volatility without real benefits for long-term investors?\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/nasdaq-moves-to-near-24-hour-trading-some-say-thats-a-bad-idea.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

Discovery's board of directors may announce its decision on Paramount Sky Dance's $108.4 billion acquisition offer as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. The board is expected to recommend shareholders vote against the bid.\n\nThe renewed acceptance of Netflix's acquisition offer marks the latest development in this bidding war. The target of this contest includes Warner Bros.' storied film and television studio, along with its vast library of movies and TV shows a portfolio spanning classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to contemporary hits such as Harry Potter and Friends, as well as the HBO and HBO Max streaming services.\n\nA Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe winner will gain a significant advantage in the streaming wars by securing a vast content library that has long been a target for acquisition.\n\nEarlier this month, Netflix ultimately prevailed in its $27 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Warner Bros.' non-cable assets.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison subsequently made a direct, all-cash $30-per-share takeover bid to Warner Bros. shareholders.\n\nParamount stated in filings submitted to regulators that its acquisition proposal is superior to Netflix's bid and more likely to secure regulatory approval. Paramount's acquisition plan consists of $41 billion in new equity backed by the Ellison family and Redbird Capital, along with $54 billion in debt financing commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo Global Management.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Affinity Partners, a firm owned by Jared Kushner and one of Paramount Pictures' financing partners, will withdraw from the competition.\n\nParamount Pictures and Affinity Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.",

      "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery Set to Reject Paramount Takeover Bid\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is preparing to advise its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance’s hostile takeover bid, with a formal recommendation expected as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount’s proposal valued Warner Bros. Discovery at roughly $108 billion in an all-cash offer, or about $30 per share, but board members have expressed concerns over the offer’s financing, structure and overall terms compared with other strategic options. The board appears inclined to recommend the company’s existing deal with Netflix which combines cash and stock and focuses on core studio and streaming assets as a more secure and valuable path forward for shareholders.\n\nThe market has reacted to the escalating deal drama, with Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock weakening as news of the planned rejection circulated. Investors are watching closely as Paramount’s bid backed in part by funding from equity and debt partners faces internal resistance, and as other players like Netflix remain in contention. \n\nAlso, Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners has reportedly exited the takeover battle, marking a shift in financing participation for the Paramount bid. Paramount still has time to revise or sweeten its offer before its tender deadline in early January, but Warner Bros. Discovery’s board seems poised to side with the alternative that they believe offers greater certainty and value for shareholders",

Assuming technology is the driver of further economic growth it seems a refocus on industry and physical assets is inevitable.  \n\n  \nMy argument is that exponential advancement in software capabilities shifts value into physical assets.  Without laying out a dissertation, essentially money goes somewhere to pay people, and highly skilled labor will remain untouched by AI until robotics themselves become economically viable to replace skilled labor.\n\nEnter industry.  Whether it's factory automation, infrastructure to support, tooling and maintenance, or the manufacturing of actual assets themselves that are produced, skilled labor is required across all of it.  Execution that bridges into the physical world cannot be performed directly by software systems.  Companies need to fund that labor, and the companies that control the labor become valuable.\n\n  \nUnless UBI somehow becomes a thing, I don't really see another avenue toward economic viability in G20 economies 3-5+ years out.\n\nI post here because industrial companies outside of a few name brands like GE and CAT are generally quite cheap on the market.\n\nAnyone care to share opinions or thoughts?

Discovery's board of directors may announce its decision on Paramount Sky Dance's $108.4 billion acquisition offer as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. The board is expected to recommend shareholders vote against the bid.\n\nThe renewed acceptance of Netflix's acquisition offer marks the latest development in this bidding war. The target of this contest includes Warner Bros.' storied film and television studio, along with its vast library of movies and TV shows a portfolio spanning classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to contemporary hits such as Harry Potter and Friends, as well as the HBO and HBO Max streaming services.\n\nA Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe winner will gain a significant advantage in the streaming wars by securing a vast content library that has long been a target for acquisition.\n\nEarlier this month, Netflix ultimately prevailed in its $27 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Warner Bros.' non-cable assets.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison subsequently made a direct, all-cash $30-per-share takeover bid to Warner Bros. shareholders.\n\nParamount stated in filings submitted to regulators that its acquisition proposal is superior to Netflix's bid and more likely to secure regulatory approval. Paramount's acquisition plan consists of $41 billion in new equity backed by the Ellison family and Redbird Capital, along with $54 billion in debt financing commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo Global Management.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Affinity Partners, a firm owned by Jared Kushner and one of Paramount Pictures' financing partners, will withdraw from the competition.\n\nParamount Pictures and Affinity Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.",

The last 10 years have been close, but BRK still pulled ahead.  \n\nWith Buffett stepping down and BRK being a very mature company now, can it still outperform $VOO over the next 10 years?  My thought is that active investing may actually start to outperform again.  Over 50% of fund flows are now into passive/indexing and there is risk of a bubble forming there.  This means when those passive funds nosedive hard, active investors with the cash can swoop in and buy their exaggerated lows.  Also, with the S&amp;P 500 extremely valued on so many metrics:  CAPE/Shiller P/E, Buffet Indicator (market cap-to-GDP), and regular P/E, I think return prospects won’t be very good over the next 10 years in U.S. stocks.  \n\nI like emerging markets, precious metals, and individual stocks more.  \n\nBut I think active investing may finally make a comeback too and beat passive with this setup.  If you HAD TO ONLY CHOOSE ONE, which would you rather hold:  BRK or VOO over the next 10 years.  You cannot sell the holding, nor invest in the other until 2035.  😋",

I hate Elon both politically and as a human, I think Tesla makes good cars.\n\nMy list of winners I've picked correctly where I've made at least 50% in the last 24 months include (shorts with a (-) sign): PWRMF, ACMR, GOOGL, LAC, SIVR, SPOT, RTX -BUMBL.\n\nMy list of losers that are down at least 20% in the last 24 months: PYPL, GETY, UBER, -PTON, -TSLA, -DJT.\n\nTo understand Tesla stock we need to understand asset classes as a whole. Think residential real estate and MBS. Think Bitcoin. Think gold. In stocks we claim this measure to be ETFs like VOO or SPY.\n\nSo, here's the problem: the dollar is losing value. You can measure this against other currencies, or bitcoin or any metric. We are printing money and growing out debt and inflation is happening and will continue to happen.\n\nSo rich people need to hedge against this. Gold is up 114% and silver 116% in the last years. At the same time, Bitcoin is up 104%. Real estate fairly flat (after double digit gains in 2021 and 2022) but still. up around 6-8% over the same time period. SPY is up 46.4% over the same time period.\n\nSo when all assets are up, and inflation is up, its not just performance driving the price.\n\nAmong these asset classes, the stock market the best combination of liquid, tax-favorable, legal and safe. No one puts their 401k in gold, bitcoin is quasi legal still and real estate is very illiquid. What Obama learned and then Biden and Trump is that stonks needs to always go up. In our K shaped economy, it's no longer unemployment or inflation as the Fed's dual mandate claims, but keep the stock market smooth and you will get credit for keeping things smooth. Through bank bailouts, auto bail outs, mortgage meltdowns, Covid, tariffs, war, WHO GIVES AF. The wealthiest 10% own 50% of the stock market and they need to keep their wealth compounding to keep their donations flowing. \\*\\*We will print money, we will take part ownership in companies, we will buy bad loans, we literally do fking anything other than let the stock market go down.\\*\\*\n\nNow here's the question: What IS the stock market? Typically the largest and wealthiest funds take giant stakes in Blue chip companies and broad based ETS. But what do you do when automation/stagflation is muting dividends and small returns of mature industrials and the Mag7 hot tech stocks represent 35% of the entire S&amp;P.\n\nIf you're say a president who's obsessed with the stock market, and is known for transactional dealings and favorable deals to friends, and you want to keep the stock market afloat, what is easier - to keep buoying a small number of really big stocks or try and do an FDR style new deal to drive the engine of commerce and lift all boats with a rising tide? It's waaaay easier to just say \"Hey Jensen, hey Elon, lets make these deals\".\n\nIf you're a crony with money, whose entire wealth and livelihood depends on your assets under management increasing, same question. Now if you two team up together? Institutional fund diamond hands means government contracts and favorable tax deals.\n\n**It's all a long way of saying Tesla (and Mag7 broadly) have become too big too fail**. If we bailed out fucking Ford and GM because of auto jobs in detroit you can bet your ass we will bail out every Americans 401k, all of which rely on Mag7. The only reason the other companies in Mag7 haven't been exposed is that they actually increase profit and are worth the money. If tesla traded even at 2x the forward 12 month PE of its peers we'd see it lose 60% in market cap which would trigger a broad meltdown of the entire stock market and probably trigger a panic sell off.\n\n**\\*\\*So TL;DR -\\***\\* rich people need stocks to go up to keep their money safe from inflation. Telsa and Mag7 are needed to go up for this to happen, so the oligarchs and our government simply won't let them fail. Tesla is a store of value like bitcoin more than a stock that operates on fundamentals like P/E and earnings growth",

      "title": "$PHR - Some of the best value on the market",
      "content": "$PHR - Some of the best value on the market\n\n# Overview\n\n$PHR Phreesia is a provider of software for the healthcare industry. Founded in 2005, their business model has proven to be very strong, currently working with 4520 clients within the USA. These include companies with big names such as Tenet Healthcare, Optum, Piedmont Healthcare, and more. They also help organizations of smaller sizes, such as community health centers and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). In 2024, Phreesia’s software powered over 170 million patient visits across the USA, or 1 in 7 visits.\n\n# What do they do?\n\nPhreesia’s platform allows businesses to automate patient check-ins, give patients personalized health-related content, process patients payments, provides aggregate data for organizations to better understand their own business processes, and much much more. Simply put, Phreesia maximizes efficiency for businesses, allowing for a one stop shop for patient relations.\n\n# Financials\n\nPhreesia’s financials are an investors dream. Since their IPO in 2019, they have grown revenue by \\~20% YoY. From 2023 Q3 until now, (Q3 2026, their fiscal year) they have grown net margins at an impressive rate from -54.95% to 3.55%, now being profitable. In 2026 Q3, their **FCF nearly quintupled YoY, EBITDA nearly tripled YoY**, and net income was $4.3 million from -$14.4 million Q3 last year. Phreesia increased their number of clients 7% YoY, and increased revenue per client by a further 6% YoY to $26,622. They expect to increase both total number of clients and revenue per clients by **low double digits in 2027.** and cash equivalents sit at $106.4 million while total liabilities sit at $103.1 million, proving Phreesia is extremely healthy being able to pay off all their debt with cash. Phreesia also raised their FY 2026 guidance, expecting slightly more revenue and EBITDA than previously forecasted. They posted 2027 guidance, calling for revenue to be \\~$559 million, up 16% from 2026. 2027 EBITDA should be in the range of $125 million to $135 million which would be a \\~30% increase YoY.  Phreesia also completed an **all cash acquisition** in Q3 2026 of AccessOne, a market leader in financing solutions for healthcare companies. AccessOne currently manages a receivables portfolio of $450 million. Phreesia expects AccessOne to contribute $35 million of revenue annually and $11 million of EBITDA.\n\nOverall, Phreesia has proven to be a growth powerhouse and expects to continue growing revenue, income and client base at a respectable, considerably above average rate. Phreesia is also expanding their portfolio with their recent acquisition.\n\n# Valuation + Conclusion\n\nAs of December 16th, $PHR sits at $16.35 with a market cap of $985M. This is down considerably from its all time high of $81.59 and quite close to its all time low of $12.05. Phreesia has a P/S ratio of \\~2, arguably too low especially given their revenue growth. Their FWD P/E ratio is 40, arguably high but in my opinion taking their EPS growth and overall growth into account is pretty fair. P/FCF ratio is \\~19, pretty average but it deserves to be higher taking their cash flow growth into account. Their price to cash ratio is \\~9, which is low as well. Overall, their valuation isn’t the lowest on the market but I believe that for what Phreesia is, it’s extremely good value right now. I don’t have a position currently, but when I sell out of one of my positions I plan on loading up on shares or scaling into at the money leaps. With how great they have been doing, I don’t see any reason for it to even test the all time low again, but worst case scenario I think that \\~$12 would be the lowest Phreesia would go. In my opinion, a very good risk to reward ratio considering that in a few years with the best case scenario, Phreesia could be a $100 stock.\n\nThank you for reading and happy investing / trading!",

Few months ago it traded a similar or even lesser mcap to Amazon. The run up on Google was justified due to the company rapidly building and scaling its AI products. The important question to ask is the scope of higher return from here on especially since so much is priced into the stock.\n\nAmazon on the other hand has been viewed as a company with lesser growth outlook due to tariff and rising competition to its AWS business. I look at it differently. They are spending aggressively on AI infrastructure, if they build lot of capacity, they have a way to monetize it in one way or another since they have a more diversified stream of businesses. They also have scope of expanding their retail margins all of which can contribute to growing its earning power significantly.\n\nLong Amazon!",

      "title": "Meta: Metaverse Cuts Are Not The Story. How It Affects AI Spend Is",
      "content": "Meta: Metaverse Cuts Are Not The Story. How It Affects AI Spend Is\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe reported cuts to the Reality Labs’ budget have likely been overstated. First, it is unclear how big the cuts are and which part of Reality Labs they affect. Will it just be VR and the Metaverse, or will augmented reality (smart glasses) be included? Reports are of 10% and 30% cuts. Again, how will this be spread out?\n\nIf we assume it is 30% of the entirety of Reality Labs, which I don’t believe. With expenses of \\~$16 billion, that would be over $4 billion in cuts. But remember, Meta is expected to have expenses in the range of $116-$118 billion in 2025, which will accelerate in 2026. $4 billion is not all that significant compared to the massive spend on AI.\n\nThis metaverse cut is not that big of a deal. What is important is what it tells us about the AI spend and Metas’ willingness to cut it back if needed. Therefore, I see two likely outcomes for Meta. One, Mark Zuckerberg will reduce spend in the face of weak demand for AI, or two, AI will be a success and the high spend will continue.\n\nDoing a discounted cash flow valuation on both cases, I find Meta to be good value in either scenario. I get a weighted valuation of $950.\n\nImage: Reality Labs Revenue And Expenses\n\nI wasn't able to add images, you can search the same title for my Substack post to see them. Oh, I had to take out the reference links as Reddit was auto-blocking the post, I think.\n\n# Zuckerberg's Willingness To Change\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s willingness to change should not have come as a massive surprise. There are multiple examples throughout Zuckerberg's career where he has shown this flexibility.\n\nIn 2008, he embraced advertising, something he had long had doubts about, brought in Cheryl Sandberg, and gave up a lot of operational control when it was felt they needed an ‘Adult in the room’.\n\nAround 2010, Zuckerberg was all in on Facebook being a web-based platform without the need for a dedicated app. When that was proven wrong, they pivoted. Before long, they had one of the most popular apps in the world.\n\nAnd of course, more recently, they went all in on the metaverse, even changing the name of the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021. Then, in the 2022 Q4 report, they announced the ‘year of efficiency’. I see last week's reports of cuts in the metaverse as a continuation of this change of direction.\n\nIt is this history that gives me, and I believe some of the market, faith that Zuckerberg can change direction if it becomes clear that the massive AI spend is not generating the desired returns.\n\n# Two Scenarios\n\nTo help me value the company, I found it useful to think of two scenarios and do separate valuations for each of them. Scenario 1, AI returns do not appear, and cuts in CapEx are needed. Scenario 2, AI leads to increased revenue.\n\n**Scenario 1: Cuts to AI spend**\n\nMeta has been quite clear that AI has given tangible benefits to their underlying business. Most analysts expect over 15% growth in the next 12 months. In this scenario, I'm going to assume it ends there. Algorithms are as optimised as they can get, there are no more efficiencies to find, and no new AI revenue sources appear.\n\nImage: DCF Model For Scenario 1: Reduced CapEx\n\nI am modelling revenue falling back to a still respectable 8%, which will then trail off to a terminal growth rate of 5%. This may seem high given a failed AI pivot, but keep in mind the underlying business is still dominant in the world of social media. Ad spend is still migrating to online, the world, especially outside the US, is getting richer, and there is no reason to think that Meta will not continue to grow for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs we discussed in his history, I believe Zuckerberg will pivot in the face of an AI failure and reduce Capex and spend. Barring any writedown, this will likely take a number of years as depreciation works its way through the books. I am modelling EBIT margin to rise from the current \\~40% to a terminal margin of 49%. And for the terminal reinvestment, I'm assuming a return on invested capital of 20%.\n\nImage: Final DCF Calculations\n\nPutting all these numbers together. I get a valuation of $861. So even in the scenario of a failed AI buildout, there is a case for Meta to be good value. With that said, it is easy to see the stock selling off in that situation, which could allow for an even more attractive entry.\n\n# Scenario 2: AI is moderately successful\n\nAI succeeding is such a general statement that it is very difficult to model. I will assume their revenues remain higher for longer as they continue to reap the rewards of AI, both in their core business and in any new business models that come from AI. I am modelling them to have 20% growth, trailing off to 15% in 4 years, and then trailing off to a terminal growth rate of 5.5%.\n\nImage: DCF Model For Scenario 2: AI Moderate Success\n\nTo support this growth, I am continuing the high CapEx spend, but with that said, I am assuming that the costs are front-loaded and relative to revenue, CapEx will actually fail. I am modelling this as EBIT margins remaining fairly steady, with a terminal rate of 37%. For the terminal reinvestment, I am assuming a return on invested capital of 15%.\n\nImage: Final DCF Calculations\n\nAdding all that up gets me to a valuation of $1,115. Of course, there is plenty of room in this 'AI moderate success' scenario for more upside. I see this as a conservative valuation.\n\n# Combining The Models\n\nWhen I do more than one valuation model, I like to get a weighted average between them, which means we have to give each scenario a likelihood.\n\nWhile I believe AI will be transformational, I'm not convinced Meta will be the one to build it. For that reason, I'm putting ‘reduced CapEx’ as the slightly more likely scenario and giving it a 65% weighting.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, if a company wants to be successful, it will need piles of money, abundant sources of data, and a willingness to go for it. Zuckerberg and Meta have all of that. I am putting a weighting of 35% on the ‘AI moderately successful’ scenario.\n\nImage: Weighted Average Calculation\n\nAI will succeed or fail. It is black or white, but I do like to work in the grey middle, so for my overall valuation, I will be using this weighted average of $950. \n\nGiven the different potential outcomes, it will be important to regularly update this model and my $950 valuation. For now, I am confident in placing a BUY target on the stock.\n\n# Risks\n\nZuckerberg has full control over Meta with his super-voting rights. And while in the past he's shown a willingness to change direction. A shareholder still has to accept that they are at the whims of one person. If he digs his heels in and says he will succeed in AI or take Meta down with him, there is not much we can do\n\nAs with any international company, there will be regulation and antitrust risk. From European Union fines to the Austrailian under 16 ban, there is a constant risk on this front.\n\nIf AI is as disruptive as many think it will be, there is no valuation model, no company, and perhaps no industry that is safe.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMeta giving up on the metaverse is not the real story here. The real story is that once again, Mark Zuckerberg has shown a willingness to change direction when needed. The market sees that willingness to change direction as a safety net. If AI succeeds, great, shareholders will reap the rewards. If it fails, Zuckerberg will cut his losses, rightsize the company, and continue to run the world's largest social media empire.\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my Substack for more valuations like this.\n\n",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-16 21:21:20  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Bearish with pockets of speculative retail activity**  \n- **Macro & Commodity Pressure:** WTI crude oil below $55 (lowest since early 2021) signals deflationary/disinflationary fears and weakening global demand. This is a dominant theme in Reddit discussions and aligns with broader growth concerns.  \n- **Equity Risk Premium (4.33%)** and **10Y Treasury Yield (4.18%)** indicate a still-elevated cost of capital, weighing on risk assets.  \n- **VIX at 16.5** suggests moderate but not panicked volatility expectations.  \n- **Retail Sentiment (Reddit):** Mixed—discussions highlight stagnation (e.g., “Started the year with $155K…ending at $155K”), bankruptcy (iRobot), and meme-stock activity (GameStop +0.91%). This reflects retail frustration but also persistent speculative behavior in single names.  \n- **News Flow:** China/Asia focus (chipmaker IPO frenzy, currency moves) shows regional volatility but not broad bullish catalysts for US markets.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES:  \n**A. Commodity Weakness & Inflation Dynamics**  \n- Oil’s breakdown (WTI sub-$55) is a major headline across Reddit and implies disinflationary pressure.  \n- CPI at 324.368 (level, not % change) needs context, but oil drop may ease near-term inflation fears.  \n- Gold (GLD $395.89) is not spiking despite oil plunge, suggesting deflationary hedging rather than stagflation.  \n\n**B. Media/Streaming Consolidation & Speculative M&A**  \n- Warner Bros rejecting Paramount bid, favoring Netflix alliance—highlights streaming wars and content consolidation.  \n- Retail attention on media deals could spark volatility in names like WBD, PARA, NFLX.  \n\n**C. AI/Chip Investment & Speculation**  \n- Amazon’s $10B investment in OpenAI (Reddit) signals continued AI arms race.  \n- Chinese chipmaker MetaX soaring 755% (Bloomberg) points to extreme speculative fervor in semiconductors, albeit regionally focused.  \n\n**D. Retail Trader Fatigue & Meme-Stock Residual Activity**  \n- Reddit posts show stagnation anecdotes and continued focus on GameStop.  \n- iRobot bankruptcy and delisting—cautionary tale for distressed/high-retail-ownership stocks.  \n\n**E. Asia-Pacific Market Divergence**  \n- India rupee rallying on RBI support; Korean won hitting 8-month lows—divergent EM stories.  \n- China attempting to shed “uninvestable” tag amid chip IPO mania and soy auction increases.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS:  \n**Immediate Catalysts:**  \n- **Oil breakdown** → energy sector under pressure, potential drag on HY credit and energy-heavy indices.  \n- **Employment data** (BLS report trending on Reddit) — unemployment rate at 4.6% suggests labor market softening, aligning with disinflationary oil move.  \n- **Fed Funds Rate at 3.64%** — restrictive policy still in place, limiting equity upside.  \n\n**Forward Signals:**  \n- **VIX** not spiking despite oil plunge → complacency or expectation of Fed dovish pivot?  \n- **TotalEnergies CEO** (Bloomberg) talking up demand → possible counter-narrative to oil bearishness.  \n- **Extreme IPO pops** (MetaX +755%) → sign of speculative froth in tech/chips, but geographically siloed.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT:  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Demand Shock:** Oil below $55 may reflect weakening global growth, not just supply.  \n2. **Retail Overhang:** Meme-stock volatility (GameStop, bankruptcies like iRobot) could create localized selloffs.  \n3. **Asia Contagion:** Korean won weakness + stock outflows could spread to other EMs.  \n4. **High Rates:** ERP at 4.33% shows equity risk premium attractive, but high real yields still pressure valuations.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Disinflation Trade:** Bonds may rally if oil drop feeds into lower inflation expectations.  \n2. **AI Infrastructure:** Amazon/OpenAI deal reinforces cloud/AI investment theme.  \n3. **EM Divergence:** India strength vs. Korea weakness → selective EM opportunities.  \n4. **Streaming M&A:** Potential bid-ask spread plays in media (WBD, PARA) if deal rumors persist.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:  \n**SECTOR: Energy — Avoid/Cautious**  \n- Oil price breakdown suggests further downside. Avoid long energy exposure until stabilization.  \n- Monitor XLE for breakdown below key levels; consider hedging with bearish energy ETFs if trend confirms.  \n\n**SECTOR: Semiconductors — Speculative Long with Caution**  \n- AI investment (Amazon/OpenAI) supports chip demand, but Chinese IPO mania signals froth.  \n- Focus on US large-cap semis (NVDA, AMD) over speculative small-caps.  \n\n**SYMBOL: WBD / PARA — Event-Driven Watch**  \n- M&A speculation may create volatility. Watch for official statements on Paramount bid rejection.  \n- Potential pairs trade: long WBD (if Netflix alliance seen as positive) vs. short PARA if bid fails.  \n\n**MACRO: Fixed Income — Consider Duration**  \n- Oil plunge + stable gold suggests disinflation trade. TLT or long-duration treasuries may benefit if growth fears accelerate.  \n\n**SYMBOL: GME — Retail Sentiment Gauge**  \n- GameStop still trending with retail. Use as sentiment indicator for meme-stock risk appetite.  \n- Not a fundamental play—watch for high-volume breaks above/below $22.29 for short-term momentum signals.  \n\n**REGION: India vs. Korea — Relative Value**  \n- Long INR/KRW cross or consider ETFs: favor India (INDA) over Korea (EWY) on central bank policy divergence.  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**  \nThe market is bearish-leaning due to oil demand fears and restrictive monetary policy. Retail sentiment is fatigued but still speculative in pockets. Focus on disinflation trades (bonds), avoid energy, and watch M&A volatility in media. Asia offers selective opportunities amid divergence. Maintain defensive positioning with tactical plays in AI semis and event-driven media names.",

It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government, which has blocked imports of less powerful chips, such as Nvidia’s H20.\n\nThe move, which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, could bolster Nvidia’s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide.\n\nThe US enacted strict export restrictions under the Biden Administration in an effort to prevent China from catching up on AI. But some in the White House believe those restrictions have more or less failed, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n    \n[Source](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/08/2025/commerce-to-open-up-exports-of-nvidia-h200-chips-to-china)",

      "content": "Carvana $CVNA is Highly Fraudulent\n\nCredentials:  14 year automotive veteran.  15 year options trader\n\nBullet Points:\n\n1) Carvana’s profit margins are too good to be true.  The best companies in the industry don’t come close to their 19% gross profit margins.  \n\n2) The CEO of Carvana (Ernest Garcia III) Also owns a privately owned auto business named Drivetime.  Drivetime is a dumpster fire.\n\n3) Ernest Garcia III has been funneling his unwanted Carvana inventory to Drivetime to prop up Carvana’s earnings.  Drivetime overpays Carvana for this inventory and then takes the loss on their own balance sheets.\n\n4) Over the last few months Ernest Garcia III has been selling tens of millions of dollars of stock to keep Drivetime afloat\n\n5) Carvana has issued roughly 15.3 million shares over the last year.  At average $330 price this comes to roughly 5 Billion USD.  None of this reflects on the company’s financial report.  \n\nThesis:\n\nBased on CVNA October 2025 earnings report the company’s equity attributed to shareholders increased by 1B usd.\n\nIn the same period the company issued ~15.3 million shares worth over 5B usd.  None of this issuance reflects on the company’s balance sheets.  Healthy companies issue dividends and buy back stock.  Carvana has no dividend and has issued billions in stock solely to their core insiders.\n\nDrivetime (a company owned by Carvana’s CEO) has the worst inventory I have ever seen.  Thousands and thousands of cars that are absolutely overpriced garbage.  Some of the cars they have been sitting on for over 6 months.  \n\nIn October and September of 2025 Ernest Garcia III has sold roughly 82 million dollars of carvana stock.  \n\nI am not a private investigator, financial pro, or accountant, but to me the evidence is compelling that carvana’s results are being directly propped by DRIVETIME and once the Garcias have enriched themselves the real results will emerge.\n\nI plan to open short positions against CVNA in the next few weeks after they fully transition to the SP 500",

      "content": "Quiet Part Said Out Loud….  SEC Commisioner Caroline Crenshaw: Statement on Extension of Compliance Dates for Securities Lending Reporting and Short Position and Short Activity Reporting\n\nSTATEMENT\nStatement on Extension of Compliance Dates for Securities Lending Reporting and Short Position and Short Activity Reporting\nCommissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw\nDec. 3, 2025\nRecently I expressed my concern about “Repeal by Extension”—the concept of using compliance date extensions that are long in duration to indefinitely delay the compliance dates of final rules.[1] I am disappointed that this pattern continues today with the issuance of an exemptive order[2] that provides a two-year compliance date extension for two rules aimed at increasing transparency in the securities lending and short sale markets: Rule 10c-1a (Securities Lending Reporting) [3] and Rule 13f-2 (Short Position and Short Activity Reporting) (collectively, the “Rules”).[4] The Commission adopted both of these Rules in 2023 under rulemaking authority granted by Congress through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank”),[5] the well-known legislative response to the wreckage generated by the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nLet me briefly explain how we got here. Trade groups challenged the Rules on various grounds, and, on August 25, 2025, the Fifth Circuit largely rejected the arguments they raised.[6] It did, however, agree with one argument and remanded the Rules to the Commission, without vacating them, to allow the Commission “to analyze [the Rules’] cumulative economic impact and respond[] to further comments in view of that analysis.”[7] The Court determined that “there is at least a serious possibility that the agency will be able to substantiate its decision given an opportunity to do so.”[8]\n\nIt should not take two years to complete a narrow revision of the Rules’ economic analyses consistent with the Court’s request. This could be done expeditiously and concisely. However, rather than following the Court’s narrow directive, the Commission not so subtly signals that no one should even bother with implementation; the Rules will be changing.[9]\n\nThe right (and legal) thing to do would be to implement the Rules, which are already effective since the Fifth Circuit declined to vacate them. If extra time is truly necessary to allow registrants more runway to prepare for the Rules in light of the Court’s decision, this could be accomplished by a short compliance date extension.[10] Any future modifications should be addressed separately, as required by statute, through notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n\nUnder the guise of compliance date extensions, we are attempting to camouflage a new willingness to repeatedly bend the rules until they break—eroding the rule of law.",

Waymo is one of the largest positions in Tiger’s 2024 fund.\n\nWaymo declined to comment.\n\nThis year, Waymo has also announced a slew of expansions, including its debut on freeways in three cities, and autonomous driving in cities including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando.\n\nThe latest milestone is also another sign that Waymo is continuing to push ahead of aspiring self-driving competitor Tesla, which has run limited pilots in Austin and operates a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area.\n\nTesla vehicles include human drivers or safety supervisors on board and are not driverless like Waymo’s fleet vehicles.\n\nAccording to Tesla’s latest earnings call, executives said the company hit a quarter of a million miles with its fleet in Austin, and more than one million in the Bay Area. In July, Waymo announced 100 million total fully autonomous miles.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html)",

Combs, who has been both an investment officer at Berkshire and CEO of Geico, will be moving to JPMorgan Chase.\nAt JPMorgan, he’ll lead a newly created Security and Resiliency Initiative focused on direct equity investments across defense, aerospace, healthcare, and energy. He had already been serving on JPMorgan’s board before this move.\nWith Buffett transitioning out and now Combs leaving, it really feels like Berkshire is entering a new chapter. Curious how people here view the long-term impact of these changes on Berkshire’s investment culture and operating businesses.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/berkshire-hathaways-todd-combs-investment-lieutenant-to-buffett-and-geico-ceo-is-leaving-for-jpmorgan.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "content": "Inside Wealth: Rising stocks and IPOs helped create 287 new billionaires this year\n\nAccording to the UBS Billionaire Ambitions Report 2025, a total of 287 new billionaires were created this year, pushing the global count to 2,919. Total billionaire wealth rose to a record $15.8 trillion by the end of Q3, up about 13% from last year. Out of the total, 2,059 billionaires are self-made while 860 inherited their wealth. This is the second-highest number of new billionaires UBS has ever recorded, behind only 2021. Over the last four years alone, 727 people have crossed the billionaire mark. While tech and AI still dominate headlines, this year’s new billionaires came from a wider mix of sectors including software, genetics, infrastructure, natural gas, and even restaurants. Some of the new names include Colossal co-founder Ben Lamm, Stonepeak CEO Michael Dorrell, and Venture Global founders Bob Pender and Mike Sabel.\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/rising-stocks-ipos-new-billionaires-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/rising-stocks-ipos-new-billionaires-2025.html)",

It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government, which has blocked imports of less powerful chips, such as Nvidia’s H20.\n\nThe move, which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, could bolster Nvidia’s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide.\n    \n[Source](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/08/2025/commerce-to-open-up-exports-of-nvidia-h200-chips-to-china)",

      "content": "Michael Saylor just pitched countries on creating Bitcoin backed digital banking systems and the concept is pretty wild.\n\nSpeaking in Abu Dhabi, Saylor laid out a vision where countries could use Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit to offer regulated bank accounts that give way higher returns than traditional deposits. He pointed out that banks in Japan, Europe and Switzerland barely pay any interest while US money market funds are around 4%. People are basically disgusted with their bank accounts which is why corporate bonds exist.\n\nHis proposal involves structuring accounts with about 80% digital credit instruments, 20% regular currency, and an extra 10% buffer to reduce volatility. The digital credit layer would be backed by Bitcoin reserves with about 5 to 1 overcollateralization. Basically using Bitcoin as the ultimate collateral layer.\n\nSaylor thinks a country that implements this could attract $20 to $50 trillion in deposits and become the digital banking capital of the world. Thats not a small claim.\n\nHowever theres obvious skepticism here. Bitcoin is down 28% from its recent highs and dropped 9% over the past year. The volatility makes people question how you can build stable high yield products on top of it. One former bond trader called Saylors moves folly and said hiking rates to maintain a peg wont work when people want their money back during a panic.\n\nStrategy already has a product called STRC that works somewhat like this - its grown to $2.9 billion but faces doubts about whether it can handle a real liquidity crunch.\n\nThe idea is innovative but feels like it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating long term to actually work.

They are the only clean way out of AI driven price chaos. Local generation, local storage, local control.

With the missing October data, and the compromised November data, I actually think they might opt to hold rates steady until they have a more complete data set in January. From their point of view there is no harm in waiting; one month won't make a big difference in the long term. Looking at the most recent reports, the data doesnt seem to support the notion that inflation is coming down or that joblessness is much worse than it was earlier this year--look at the charts. I'm sure a lot of you want to tell me that the job market is trash, and I agree, but it's not in the data. And we definitely can't be certain that tariffs are gone for good. I'm preparing for a bloodbath this Wednesday, maybe even the beginning of the AI crash. ",

But the key question is **what happens next year**.\n\nPowell's term ends in May next year, and Trump has already picked his successor (likely Kevin Hassett, White House National Economic Council Director, super dovish). Market rumors say it could be announced before Christmas.\n\n**Two variables for next year:**\n\n1. **New chair will be more dovish** \\- Hassett wrote \"Dow 36,000,\" advocates for quick rate cuts and tax cuts, absolutely bullish for stocks. 1-2 cuts next year should be solid.\n2. **Tariff situation is settled** \\- Trump's tariff policy is basically done negotiating, deals are signed, exemptions granted. Although some furniture and lumber tariffs will increase next year, overall it won't spike like it did in April. Supreme Court is reviewing tariff legality, but even if overturned, Trump has other legal tools available, minimal impact.\n\n**What about tomorrow?**\n\nFutures are already up 0.4%, likely opening with a small gain of 0.2-0.5%. Real direction depends on Powell's 2:30 PM press conference. If he's optimistic about next year, Nasdaq pushes to 23,700-24,000. If he's still worried about inflation, might pullback to 23,300.\n\n**What about 2026?**\n\nWall Street predicts Nasdaq up 15-25% next year, targeting 27,000-30,000. Logic: AI continues burning cash, tech earnings grow 15-20%, new chair more dovish, tariffs won't get worse.\n\nBottom line - next year's hand is actually pretty good. Powell's out, someone who loves cutting rates comes in; tariff war's over, no more chaos. Nasdaq's up 22% this year, another run next year isn't impossible.",

      "content": "ASML is entering a 10-year virtuous cycle driven by skyrocketing chip complexity. Market underestimates industry outperformance potential. Could you provide feedback on my growth thesis?\n\nI recently studied ASML and I was astounded by how strong the growth story is. Although ASML’s moat is widely acknowledged by investors, the growth story for the next ten years is highly misunderstood and constrained to buzzwords such as “AI.” The true drivers of ASML’s growth aren’t simply “more chips required for AI,” but something far more structural, predictable, and exponential.\n\nI would love some feedback from the community. For those interested, my full article is here: [https://substack.com/home/post/p-180653543](https://substack.com/home/post/p-180653543)\n\n*The Growth Driver*\n\nThe deepest insight behind ASML’s growth comes from inverting the question. Instead of asking, “How many machines will ASML sell?”, you ask, “How many machines do chipmakers *need* to buy?” That inversion works like magic because it reframes the entire business: a customer doesn’t buy ASML machines, they buy **wafer passes**.\n\nModern chips have over 50-70 layers, and every single layer requires a pass through a lithography scanner. Crucially, as features shrink, a single layer often demands multiple passes (double-,triple-, or quadruple-patterning) just to define the wires/transistors. Each pass involves nearly all five steps (i.e. lithography, etching, etc.) we outlined above, and thus, the more passes through the factory, the more expensive and delayed a chip is. For that reason, chip manufacturers optimize their production lines to minimize wafer passes for the number of target perfect chips.\n\nFrom ASML’s standpoint, because machines have a fixed throughput, the more wafer passes the chip industry needs, the more machines they will have to buy. The core argument for ASML is that **wafer passes are about to start increasing exponentially due to increased chip complexity**, and thus, ASML will outpace industry volumes**.** The actual equation to visualize wafer pass economics is: \n\nwafer passes = chip volume \\* layers per chip \\* passes per layer\n\nEach term in that equation is accelerating—simultaneously.\n\nFinally, ASML doesn’t just benefit from more passes—it benefits from each pass becoming more valuable as it sells more machines with higher ASP than in the past. The complete growth equation is:\n\n**ASML Revenue = Wafer Passes × Revenue Per Pass**\n\nLet’s break down each multiplier.\n\n# Chip Volumes Slayed to Increase\n\n*Volume Driver #1: More Advanced Chips*\n\nThe key insight: AI requires significantly more advanced chips which in turn require more advanced lithography machinery.\n\nThis is the most intuitive growth driver. Structural forces such as AI, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and edge devices (PCs, smartphones, EV) require chips that have ever increasingly smaller features (transistors/cables) due to high computational demand. As a result, new fabs are redesigning to include a higher number of EUV and High NA machines because DUV machines are physically not capable of delivering on the advanced chips that are required.\n\nChief among the growth vectors is AI. What’s critical to observe is that we are extremely early on AI and what will accelerate adoption is increased competition to NVIDIA and the layering of AI across business/consumer applications. As more players start/continue to enter the AI chip market, the exorbitant prices NVIDIA charges must come down, which will exponentially decrease the cost of AI, and thus adoption will skyrocket over the next 10 years. This sets chip volumes to increase even more requiring an ever increasing number of advanced lithography machines by ASML.\n\n*Volume #2: Memory Transitions to EUV*\n\nThe key insight: memory chips are moving to EUV finally.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of chips, logic and memory chips. Up until recently, memory chip manufacturers (SK Hynix, Micron) were using only DUV machines due to the prohibitive cost of EUV. Nevertheless, as they pushed miniaturization to limits with their DUV machines, they hit a physics wall that forced them to finally adopt EUV. This is a colossal moment for ASML, because memory manufacturers represent 40% of semiconductor capital spending.\n\n*Volume #3: Geopolitical Sovereignty*\n\nThe key insight: governments are helping to build out domestic fabs due to strategic national security concerns.\n\nGovernments worldwide have decided that semiconductor manufacturing is a national security imperative. The U.S. CHIPS Act, EU Chips Act, Japan’s semiconductor subsidies, and programs in Korea, India, and Taiwan collectively represent over $200 billion in committed government support for fab construction.\n\nThis is driving a multi-year construction supercycle independent of end-market demand. These fabs are getting built whether or not smartphone sales grow, because the objective is strategic domestic capacity. And crucially, many of these are leading-edge fabs (to justify the subsidy investment), which means high ASML content per facility.\n\nSovereign demand introduces inefficiency in the fab market because the build out is not based on end-market demand, but rather on government strategic priorities. Nevertheless, it’s an increasing trend And ASML should be a beneficiary over the next 10 years.\n\n*Volume #4: Memory and Logic Stacking (3D Chips)*\n\nThe key insight: even if the number of final products (iPhones, laptops, servers) stays flat, 3D stacking multiply the number of chips that must be made.\n\nTraditionally, a chip is flat—think of it like a single-story building. But manufacturers are now stacking multiple chips on top of each other like floors in a skyscraper. This 3D approach solves a critical problem: you can pack more capability into the same footprint and move data between chips much faster.\n\nHigh-bandwidth memory (HBM)—the memory used in AI chips—is the clearest example. Instead of one memory chip, you stack 8-12 identical memory chips vertically and connect them with microscopic vertical tunnels. Here’s the catch: each of those 8-12 chips still needs to be manufactured individually using ASML’s machines**.** Where you previously made one memory chip, you now make twelve. Same end product, but 12x the lithography demand.\n\n# Layers Per Chip Drive More Lithography\n\n*Layers #1: Shrinking Features Require More Layers*\n\nThe key insight: every advancement in chip technology—whether moving to a newer node (node = generation, and the smaller the number the more advanced it is, i.e. 7nm —&gt; 5nm —&gt; 2nm) or adding new features like extra memory—translates directly into more physical layers, which means more passes through ASML’s lithography machines. The entire industry is getting more complex, and complexity equals more ASML equipment.\n\nHere’s a counterintuitive truth: as chip features get smaller, the chips themselves require more layers to build. It’s like saying that as you make bricks tinier, you need more floors to build the same house.\n\nWhy does this happen? Because shrinking features demands more architectural sophistication. Think of it like engineering: a small sports car needs more complex suspension, more precise manufacturing, and more parts than a simple go-kart, even though it’s trying to do fundamentally the same thing (move forward).\n\nThe result: a chip made at 7nm might have 50-60 physical layers. Move to 3nm, and you’re suddenly at 70-80 layers. That’s 30-40% more lithography passes for ASML’s machines.\n\nAnd this complexity isn’t limited to cutting-edge chips. As older process nodes mature and become cheaper to manufacture, products migrate down from 28nm to 16nm or from 40nm to 22nm to save costs. When they make that jump, they inherit 20-30 additional layers that come with the more advanced process. A chip design that needed 35 lithography passes at 28nm suddenly needs 55-60 passes at 16nm.\n\n*Layers #2: Gate-All-Around Transistors*\n\nThe key insight: The semiconductor industry is switching to a fundamentally new transistor design that requires 50% more lithography steps to manufacture. This transition is inevitable, already happening, and will affect every advanced chip made over the next decade.\n\nTransistor technology is inevitably transitioning from “FinFET” to “Gate-All-Around” transistors. Although this is highly technical, what it simply means is that GAA transistors are much harder to build. An old FinFET transistor requires about 15-20 lithography passes to manufacture. A GAA transistor requires 25-30 passes—that’s 50% more.\n\n*Layers #3: Backside Power Delivery*\n\nThe key insight: chip manufacturers are starting to print 10-15 layers of certain functionality in the back of the wafer, freeing up 10-15 layers on the front side for more advanced layers.\n\nBackside power delivery represent another architectural inflection point. Simply, up until recently, manufacturers were printing on one side of the wafer. With backside power delivery, they print 10-15 layers of certain functionality on the back of the wafer because it makes the chip significantly more efficient. In turn, this frees up more layers for the upfront side to add.\n\nBackside power is a one-way door. Once chipmakers qualify it for a chip generation, it becomes standard for all subsequent nodes because the performance and power benefits are too significant to abandon. This is 10-15 permanent additional layers added to every advanced chip going forward.\n\n*Layers #4: Energy Efficiency Requirements*\n\nThe key insight: The push for energy efficiency doesn’t reduce layers—it increases them. Every percentage point of power savings requires additional architectural sophistication, which translates directly into more lithography steps.\n\nYou might think that making chips more energy-efficient would make them simpler—but it actually does the opposite. Every time a chip is redesigned to use less power, it usually needs more tiny steps to get there.\n\nData centers are huge power hogs. AI supercomputers can suck up 50–100 megawatts—roughly the output of a small town. Companies are now limited not just by money, but by how much electricity they can use.\n\nTo make chips that use less energy, manufacturers move to smaller, more advanced designs. But smaller designs mean more layers in the chip, and each layer needs multiple passes through ASML’s machines.\n\nOn top of that, advanced chips need extra circuitry to control power and distribute electricity efficiently. Each of these features adds even more layers.\n\n# Passes Per Layer Increases\n\n*Passes #1: Fields Per Chip*\n\nThe key insight: Bigger chips and smaller machine “paintbrushes” mean more passes for ASML machines. Every chip has to be exposed in sections, and as chips get bigger or the machine’s field gets smaller, the number of passes per chip multiplies.\n\nHere’s what that means in practice: A lithography machine can only print a certain area of the wafer at a time, called a “field.” For small chips, you can fit many of them in one field per layer, so one pass is enough. But as chips get bigger, they need multiple fields per chip.\n\nModern GPUs are massive. Nvidia’s H100, for example, is almost as big as the maximum exposure area of a standard EUV machine. That means each layer needs 2 passes instead of 1. AMD’s MI300 is even larger.\n\nHigh NA machines make this more extreme. Their field size is smaller—about half of standard EUV. That same GPU now needs 3–4 passes per layer instead of 2.\n\nThe result: Every large chip now requires 2–4x more passes through the lithography machine. And chips aren’t shrinking—AI processors, server CPUs, and high-end GPUs keep getting bigger to pack in more compute.\n\nBottom line: Bigger chips plus smaller fields create a multiplier effect, dramatically increasing the number of passes per chip.\n\n*Passes #2: Stitching Complexity*\n\nThe key insight: When chips are bigger than the machine’s “paintbrush,” the sections must be stitched together perfectly, which slows everything down and forces customers to buy more machines.\n\nHere’s the story: A lithography machine can only expose a certain area at a time, called a “field.” If a chip is larger than that field, the machine has to expose multiple fields and then carefully align them to create one complete layer. This process is called stitching.\n\nStitching isn’t just putting pieces together. Each overlap requires extreme precision—down to a few nanometers. This extra work slows down the machine because it can’t just fire and move on; it must check and adjust constantly.\n\nThe effect on fabs is simple but powerful: slower throughput per machine means chipmakers need more machines to hit their production targets, even if the machine’s rated “wafers per hour” hasn’t changed.\n\nStitching large chips creates a hidden multiplier on machine demand. More complex chips + nanometer-precise stitching = more passes, more time, and ultimately more ASML machines needed.\n\n*Passes #3: Chiplets*\n\nThe key insight: Breaking a big chip into smaller chiplets actually increases the total work for lithography, because each smaller piece still needs to go through the full process, plus there’s extra work to connect them.\n\nInstead of making one large chip, modern designs often use 3–5 smaller chiplets. Each chiplet must go through all the lithography steps independently. On top of that, you need an “interposer” or base layer to connect the chiplets together.\n\nEven though interposers usually use DUV instead of EUV, this still adds significant incremental demand for lithography that didn’t exist when chips were made as a single, monolithic piece.\n\n*Passes #4: Advanced Packaging*\n\nThe key insight: The “box” the chip comes in used to be dumb plastic; now it is smart silicon. Historically, ASML’s job ended once the chip was finished. But today, chips are being broken into smaller pieces and stacked on top of each other like Lego bricks. To make these stacked chips talk to each other, manufacturers have to print millions of tiny connections *outside* the main chip. This transforms “packaging” from a low-tech plastic molding step into a high-tech lithography step—giving ASML a second bite at the apple on every device sold.\n\n# Higher Revenue Per Pass: The ASP Escalator\n\nASML’s revenue doesn’t just scale with the number of passes—it scales with the value of each pass. As the mix shifts from DUV to EUV to High NA, ASML captures exponentially more revenue per wafer processed.\n\n*Higher ASP #1: Single-Pass Patterning*\n\nThe key insight: ASML sells the world’s most expensive “delete” button. When a customer pays $380 million for a High-NA machine, they aren’t paying for “more” manufacturing; they are paying for *less*. They are buying the ability to delete 3 or 4 redundant loops of manufacturing steps. This creates a paradox: the most expensive machine on the market is actually the cheapest way to build a chip.\n\nTo understand why ASML can charge double the price for its new machines, you have to understand the nightmare of the alternative.\n\nImagine you are trying to project a highly detailed image onto a wall, but your projector is blurry (the old DUV machine). To get a sharp image, you can’t just project it once. You have to use a “trick”: you project the left edge, then the right edge, then the top, then the bottom, overlapping them perfectly to create the final picture.\n\nIn the chip world, this is called multi-patterning. To print one layer of a chip using older machines, the factory has to run the wafer through the entire assembly line 3 or 4 times. That means 3x the electricity, 3x the chemicals, and 3x the chances to accidentally break the wafer.\n\nHigh-NA is the 4K Projector. The new High-NA machine is so sharp that it can print that complex image in one single shot.\n\nThis transforms the economics of the factory:\n\n* Old Way: Buy a cheaper $150M machine, but pay to run the factory loop 4 times.\n* New Way: Buy the expensive $380M machine, but run the factory loop only once.\n\nThis is why ASML has pricing power. They know that even at $380 million, their machine is still the customer’s cheapest option because it eliminates the massive operational costs of those extra steps. ASML simply captures a portion of the money they save the customer.\n\n*Higher ASP #2: Value-Based Pricing*\n\nThe key insight: ASML can charge such a higher price for new machines (i.e. EUV, High NA) because on a per chip basis, it is cheaper for the customer than older generation machines.\n\nASML doesn’t price based on manufacturing cost—it prices based on customer value delivered. This is especially pronounced for EUV and High NA, where ASML is the sole supplier and customers have no negotiating leverage.\n\nWhen TSMC adopts High NA and achieves 1.7x transistor density improvement, that translates into billions of dollars in additional revenue from customers (Apple, Nvidia, AMD) willing to pay premium prices for cutting-edge chips. ASML captures a portion of that value through its pricing.\n\n*Higher ASP #3: Yield Improvements and Customer Economics*\n\nThe key insight: Better lithography doesn’t just make chips smaller—it improves yield, which makes expensive machines worth it.\n\nEUV and High NA reduce errors during manufacturing. They create sharper patterns, smoother edges, and fewer defects on each wafer. This means more chips actually work—what engineers call higher yield.\n\nHigher yields directly improve a chipmaker’s return on investment. If one wafer now produces 5–10% more usable chips, spending more on a High NA machine suddenly makes perfect sense. The chipmaker gets more good chips without needing more wafers.\n\n# Share of Fab Capex Expansion\n\nLithography is capturing a larger percentage of total fab equipment spending. Historically, lithography represented 20-25% of fab capex. Today, for leading-edge fabs, it’s approaching 30-35%.\n\nThis isn’t because other equipment categories are shrinking—it’s because single-pass lithography eliminates the need for redundant equipment. Multi-patterning required extra etchers, deposition tools, and metrology systems to support the additional process steps. EUV and High NA eliminate those steps, and the capital budget reallocates to lithography.\n\n# The Compounding Effect\n\nThe main point of the exponential growth in volumes/layers/passes is that ASML revenues will outpace industry volumes because machine purchasing decisions are based on wafer passes, which will skyrocket over the next decade.\n\nThe key insight is that these multipliers don’t just add—they compound:\n\n* **AI drives fab construction** → **new fabs target advanced nodes** → **advanced nodes need EUV/High NA**\n* **More layers per chip** → **DUV can’t handle the complexity** → **layers migrate to EUV** → **EUV enables even more complexity**\n* **Chips get larger** → **fields per chip increases** → **more passes required** → **more machines needed per fab**\n* **High NA eliminates multi-patterning** → **chipmakers consolidate spending on ASML** → **ASML captures larger share of fab capex** → **more R&amp;D for Hyper NA** → **cycle extends**\n\nThis is a flywheel, not a linear trend. ASML isn’t riding industry growth—it’s growing faster than the industry at every level of the stack. The company is capturing an ever-increasing share of semiconductor value creation because lithography is becoming more critical, more complex, and more irreplaceable with each generation.\n\nFor the next decade, those fundamentals point in one direction: **more machines per fab, more expensive machines per fab, and more value captured per wafer processed.**",

      "content": "Why I think consistency beats almost everything in long-term investing\n\nNot advice, just my own opinion.  I want you to know this. The more data I look at and the more cycles I experience, I think the real advantage is not timing, predictions, or choosing the perfect asset. Just sticking with a simple system long enough and it won't matter. Markets will always experience terrible declines, phases of hype, strange macro shocks...  It's not the strategy that destroys most people, it's the reaction. Every time someone abandons their plan in some parts, long-term calculations fall apart. For me, consistency has been the only thing that has really come out. It's not exciting, but it works.",

Not a recommendation, just some data points that stood out.\n\nFrom the metrics I pulled, ISSC outperforms most peers on several fronts:  \n• **ROIC \\~20%**  \n• **Revenue CAGR \\~27%**  \n• Strong margins (EBIT + gross)  \n• Valuation still around **\\~15× earnings**\n\nSo you have a company showing solid profitability and above-average growth, but priced lower than most of its peers. \n\nWith their upcoming report, it’ll be interesting to see how the market reacts and whether the numbers continue to support this trend.\n\nCurious if anyone else has looked into it.",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-08 | **Time Horizon:** Day | **Primary Audience:** Retail Traders/Investors\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Cautiously Bullish with Speculative Froth**\nThe sentiment is bifurcated. **Institutional & Macro** signals are neutral-to-cautious (steady oil, moderate VIX at 15.41, stable rates). However, **retail sentiment (via Reddit) is aggressively bullish on specific, high-beta themes**, creating pockets of extreme speculation. The overwhelming volume of M&A and tech news is fueling risk-on behavior, but this is concentrated, not broad-based.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES: Consolidation, Tech Sovereignty, & Retail Speculation**\nThree dominant themes emerge across all sources:\n*   **Media Industry Consolidation:** The hostile bid for **Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)** by Paramount/Skydance is the single largest story, dominating both Reddit and professional news. This signals a transformative phase for legacy media.\n*   **Geopolitical Tech & Trade:** The US government allowing **Nvidia (NVDA)** to sell some AI chips to China is a major catalyst, easing immediate tensions and benefiting the semiconductor sector.\n*   **Retail-Driven Speculative Mania:** Reddit is focused on momentum plays: **Bitcoin** (via MicroStrategy news), **\"meme\" equities (GME)**, and high-risk YOLO calls (e.g., \"30K SPY YOLO\"). This indicates a hunt for parabolic moves, detached from fundamental macro data.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Primary Catalyst (Next 24-72H):** The **WBD** hostile bid and potential bidding war with Netflix. This will drive volatility in media (WBD, PARA) and related arbitrage plays.\n*   **Confirmed Positive Catalyst:** **NVIDIA (NVDA)** received a regulatory green light (partial) for China AI chip sales. This removes a near-term overhang and is directly bullish for the chip sector.\n*   **Contrarian Signal:** Extreme retail bullishness on Reddit (e.g., massive SPY call YOLO) coinciding with a **VIX of 15.41** (complacency) is a classic short-term caution signal for a potential volatility spike.\n*   **Macro Signal:** The **US Equity Risk Premium of 4.33%** with a 10Y Yield at 4.14% still supports equities over bonds, but the margin is not wide, limiting upside for broad indices.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Retail Overextension:** Concentrated, euphoric sentiment in meme stocks and options (per Reddit) is fragile. Any negative catalyst could trigger rapid, correlated sell-offs in these high-beta names.\n    2.  **M&A Deal Risk:** The WBD deal is *hostile*. High likelihood of deal uncertainty, regulatory scrutiny, or a failed bid leading to significant downside in involved stocks.\n    3.  **Macro Complacency:** Low VIX and focus on speculative stories occur while macro fundamentals (CPI at 324.37, Unemployment 4.4%) show persistent inflation/stagflation risks, leaving the market exposed to a hawkish Fed shift.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **M&A Arbitrage & Ripple Effects:** The media consolidation wave offers opportunities in takeover targets, content libraries, and competing streaming services.\n    2.  **Semiconductor Resurgence:** The Nvidia news is a sector-wide positive, likely lifting AI and semiconductor equipment stocks.\n    3.  **Volatility Mispricing:** The gap between retail euphoria and stable macro indices suggests elevated risk of a volatility spike, creating opportunity for VIX-related hedges or strategies.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**Watch these symbols and sectors for the next 1-3 trading days:**\n\n*   **WBD / PARA:** **High Volatility Expected.** Monitor for official board response to the hostile bid, any competing offers (e.g., from Netflix), and arbitrage spread movements. *Action: Traders should set tight stops; investors should avoid until deal clarity emerges.*\n*   **NVDA & Semiconductor Sector (SOXX):** **Catalyst Confirmed.** The China news is a clear near-term positive. Watch for follow-through buying and sector rotation into semis. *Action: Consider long positions in NVDA or broad semi ETFs for a tactical trade.*\n*   **GME & Meme Basket:** **High Risk / High Reward.** Reddit sentiment is extremely focused here (note GME earnings imminent). The high social sentiment can drive sharp moves, but it is the *most vulnerable* to a sudden sentiment shift. *Action: For speculators only. Use extreme position sizing and defined exit points. Not an investment.*\n*   **SECTOR: Media & Entertainment:** **In Play.** The Paramount/WBD move forces a sector re-rating. Look for potential moves in other content-rich or distressed legacy players (e.g., DIS, FOXA). *Action: Research potential \"next in line\" acquisition targets.*\n*   **VIX / SPY:** **Hedge Watch.** The combination of a low VIX and retail call option euphoria (\"30K SPY YOLO\") is a warning. A break above SPY 530 (or equivalent) on low volume could be a false breakout. *Action: Consider cheap out-of-the-money VIX calls or SPY puts as portfolio insurance for the next 5-10 days.*\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is driven by idiosyncratic, stock-specific catalysts (M&A, regulatory news) against a backdrop of simmering retail speculation. **Trade the catalysts (WBD, NVDA), respect the manic retail energy but do not follow it blindly, and prepare for a potential volatility reset.** The macro data does not yet support the level of complacency observed in retail forums.",

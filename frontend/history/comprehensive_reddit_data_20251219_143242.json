This block carried a base reward of about 3.125 BTC (following the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced mining subsidies), plus additional transaction fees that pushed the total payout slightly higher. The block's hash is 0000000000000000000039a7a8d1b6b3b4f1e8e4f868c4, and it processed over 2,800 transactions, highlighting the ongoing activity on the Bitcoin network despite its immense scale.\n\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/928351\n\nI wouldn’t recommend you trying this though, as you probably will have better odds buying lottery tickets.

      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

      "content": "Musk wins appeal and restores 2018 Tesla pay deal worth $56 billion\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Delaware's Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package from Tesla, which was once valued at $56 billion. Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.”\n\nThe ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThis compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November.\n\nThe ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares.\n\nMusk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock.\n\nIn 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded.\n\nMusk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies.\n\nTesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands.\n\nIn November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales.\n\nTesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan.\n\nThe Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.",

      "content": "The Christmas rally is here!!\n\nWith the release of CPI data, Japan's rate hike implemented, the UK's rate cut finalized, the ECB holding steady, and the remaining earnings reports out, the market is poised to settle down. Its next move will be dictated by market forces alone. The Nasdaq opened higher yesterday and continued consolidating around 23,000, while Nasdaq futures posted two consecutive gains. The Christmas rally may be quietly approaching.\n\n* NVDA: Buy on dips, await bullish reversal.\n* MSFT: Trading within a range; consider going long only after it returns to 490.\n* AMZN: First stop-loss level at 220, second stop-loss level at 210.\n* AAPL: Look to 276. Only a break above 276 signals an upward trend.\n* GOOG: Faces resistance at 305. Look for a rebound near 310 to turn bullish; otherwise, remain bearish.\n* META: Wait for a pullback near 660 to confirm new support before going long.\n* TSLA: Facing strong resistance at 490, unable to boost valuation. Holders may consider liquidating positions to enjoy the holidays. Not a Musk supporter? Avoid chasing the price higher here.",

Broadcom’s debt is far larger than AMD's. \nAMD's goal is to gain market share from Nvidia. But Google's TPU performance shows that big techs can rely on their own custom chips rather than buying from Nvidia or AMD.  Therefore, I am guessing big techs will use more and more of their own custom chips in future. Considering those facts, would it be a good idea to buy Broadcom by selling all of AMD's shares? ",

Though its achievements were often overshadowed by giants like Nvidia and AMD, Micron's stock performance significantly outpaced both rivals in 2025. Year to date, Micron shares have surged nearly 200%, compared to Nvidia's 28% gain and AMD's 65% increase.\n\nWhat's your target price for MU?",

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions. These bonds would likely be best suited in a retirement account due to the federal, state, and local tax implications.",

I don't know if this is old news or if this is something that might be the next sector that is trending other than semiconductors. In my opinion I think the tech side is slowing down and only so much can be innovated when it comes to GPUs, Semis, we are now seeing RAM prices go up with data centers being built. But with data centers being built rumor has it the US power grid can barely keep up with winter (Texas / Illinois specifically) and black outs in summer. \n\nI was eyeing a few energy stocks ($BE, FSLR, GEV, BESF ETF) but I was wondering if these are already priced in? Is energy sector something that is lacking or can money be made in this sector? \n\nI think FSLR will be slower as solar can only do so much. $BE might be the way to go, GEV looks like it has amazing potential and BESF ETF too but I don't have the data on whats comprised in that ETF. (FINVIZ Subscription ran out)\n\n$BE also crashed with the rumor when SPACE X goes public they will put data centers in space, but the argument is space is cold and imo that idea is far fetched just to get Space X in the spot light. \n\nA month ago I was eyeing data center construction stocks but now with the US infrastructure I think energy might be the next trending sector?

      "content": "Is there a good list of ways/tricks/systems for minimizing tax impact from a concentrated position?\n\nCurious, since this is seemingly a common problem in tech, when a company goes IPO, suddenly someone has a large amount of their net worth in a single position, but due to high salaries + volume of positions, diversifying causes 50% of that to evaporate if they were to sell.\n\nIs there a good place to read on ways people get around this, if the goal is to stay invested, just diversified?\n\nFor example, I am aware of [Exchange Funds](https://advisor.morganstanley.com/the-horizons-group/documents/field/h/ho/horizons-group/Exchange_Funds.pdf), which basically signs a contract to enter some fund by giving your individual stocks for rights to a larger pool of stocks, creating diversification without a sale event. Issue usually is that your stock needs to be part of an exchange fund in order to participate, so options here are limited.\n\nThe thread about [\"enhanced direct indexing\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1pqoqbb/is_enhanced_direct_indexing_the_right_choice_for/) sparked my interest as well, but seems a little less straight forward since it seems to rely on taking a loan to buy a wide set of stocks via Direct Indexing, and then waiting for some of them to be \"losses\" that you can sell as you slowly unwind your loans and pull out of your concentrated position.\n\nDoes anyone have other sources? [Fidelity's generic article](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/wealth-management-insights/diversify-concentrated-positions) seems to not really know of much beyond what we discussed already.",

Now I find myself in a position where a large percentage of my portfolio is in this single security and I'm looking to diversify.\n\nI have been told that enhanced direct indexing is a good option for unwinding a concentrated position. I'm a novice here but if I understand it correctly, for a non-trivial fee, a management firm will use my concentrated position as leverage to buy long and short positions and use tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains, effectively diversifying while deferring the large taxable event.\n\nAre there big inherent risks I'm not aware of? Are there other options I should consider? I recognize there's a real risk by having nearly half of my portfolio in a single security but I don't want to make a mistake and take an even greater risk trying to unwind it. \n\nThanks!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 14:31:51 | **Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral-to-Cautiously Bullish**  \n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Mixed but leaning skeptical. Retail traders show concern over fiscal policy (national debt, generational wealth transfer), skepticism toward media narratives (\"Extreme media fud warning\"), and lingering meme-stock interest (GameStop, mining gains). However, discussions on Japan’s yield spike and \"record witching day\" suggest heightened macro awareness.  \n- **News Flow:** Bloomberg headlines indicate a \"Santa Rally\" narrative persists, with emerging markets flagged for a potential bull cycle. Corporate activity (Medtronic IPO, private equity deals) reflects risk appetite.  \n- **Market Data:** NVDA (+3.93%) and BBAI (+11.19%) show strong momentum, but low volumes in top movers (e.g., LAZR, PRPH) suggest thin liquidity—typical for a pre-holiday session. VIX at 16.87 is elevated but not panicked.  \n- **Macro Backdrop:** 10Y yield at 4.12% and Fed Funds at 3.64% indicate tight monetary policy, but equity risk premium (4.33%) remains supportive for stocks.  \n\n**Overall:** Sentiment is bifurcated—institutional optimism (Santa Rally, EM cycle) vs. retail skepticism (debt, inflation data quirks). The market is grinding higher but sensitive to headlines and quad witching.\n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES  \n**A. Macro Policy Divergence & Debt Anxiety**  \n- Reddit: National debt ($38T) and interest payments (>$1T/year) are hot topics. Japan’s BoJ hike and 10Y yield >2% (first in 15 years) signal a global shift away from ultra-loose policy.  \n- News: \"Data is very noisy\" (Bloomberg) aligns with Reddit’s skepticism on housing inflation data.  \n- Data: CPI at 325.031 suggests persistent inflation pressures, keeping rates elevated.  \n\n**B. Event-Driven Volatility**  \n- Reddit: \"FRIDAY SET FOR RECORD WITCHING DAY\" points to triple/quad witching expiration, often causing intraday swings.  \n- News: \"Santa Rally Still in Play\" but witching could disrupt the trend.  \n\n**C. Retail vs. Institutional Narratives**  \n- Reddit: Focus on meme stocks (GameStop, mining windfalls), distrust of media, and populist themes (\"U.S. stealing from millennials\").  \n- News: Institutional focus on IPOs (Medtronic), private capital deals (Golden Gate), and sector rotations (\"Old School Wall Street Trades\").  \n\n**D. Sector-Specific Catalysts**  \n- Tech/AI: NVDA strength persists; Reddit mining post hints at crypto/blockchain interest.  \n- Healthcare: Trump’s drugmaker deals (news) could boost pharma/biotech.  \n- Consumer: Nike \"nuking after hrs\" (Reddit) signals earnings volatility; Telsey cites big events boosting consumer spending.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Catalysts (Today/Tomorrow):**  \n- **Quad Witching (12/19):** Record options/futures expiration may amplify volatility, especially in meme stocks and indices.  \n- **BoJ Hike:** Japan’s yield breakout could strengthen JPY, pressure JGBs, and trigger flows out of global risk assets.  \n- **CPI Data Quirks:** November housing inflation assumption (zero) is controversial—could revise future inflation expectations.  \n\n**Underlying Signals:**  \n- **Yield Curve:** 10Y at 4.12% while Fed Funds at 3.64% suggests a still-inverted curve, recession risks linger.  \n- **VIX at 16.87:** Above 15 indicates hedging activity, consistent with witching and macro uncertainty.  \n- **Emerging Markets:** News suggests EM starting a bull cycle—watch for rotation from U.S. large caps.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Liquidity Crunch:** Low volumes (per FMP data) + witching → potential for exaggerated moves.  \n2. **Debt Dynamics:** Rising interest payments could force fiscal tightening or crowd out growth.  \n3. **Japan Spillover:** BoJ tightening may reduce global liquidity, strengthen JPY, and pressure carry trades.  \n4. **Retail Overreaction:** GameStop/AMZN chatter (Reddit) could spark meme volatility, distracting from fundamentals.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Santa Rally Momentum:** Historical seasonality + bullish news flow could push indices higher into year-end.  \n2. **EM Rotation:** Early bull cycle in emerging markets per Bloomberg—selective exposure may outperform.  \n3. **IPO Activity:** Medtronic spin-off (MiniMed) could attract healthcare capital.  \n4. **Defensive Hedges:** Gold (GLD ~$399) holding up amid yield spikes suggests safe-haven demand.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**Watchlist & Actions for Day Horizon:**  \n\n**SYMBOL: NVDA** – Strong momentum (+3.93%) but monitor witching-related gamma exposure. A close above $180 could signal continued AI leadership.  \n**SYMBOL: BBAI** – Retail interest (Reddit) + 11% surge suggests speculative momentum; set tight stops due to low volume.  \n**SECTOR: Emerging Markets** – Allocate selectively per Bloomberg’s “bull cycle” call; consider EEM or country-specific ETFs.  \n**SECTOR: Healthcare** – Trump drugmaker deals + Medtronic IPO may boost sector sentiment; watch XLV or individual pharma names.  \n**MACRO: VIX** – Hedge long positions via VIX calls or put spreads into witching close; >18 could signal broader risk-off.  \n**RISK: Liquidity** – Avoid large positions in low-volume movers (e.g., LAZR, PRPH) until post-witching stability returns.  \n\n**Critical Levels to Monitor:**  \n- **10Y Yield:** Break above 4.15% could pressure growth stocks.  \n- **VIX:** Sustain above 18 = caution; below 15 = all-clear for Santa Rally.  \n- **Gold (GLD):** Hold above $395 suggests risk-off undercurrent.  \n\n---\n\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market is navigating quad witching and macro crosscurrents with a fragile bullish bias. Focus on high-volume leaders (NVDA), avoid illiquid meme stocks, and hedge for volatility. EM and healthcare offer near-term thematic opportunities. Monitor Japan yields and VIX for directional cues.  \n\n**Next Update:** Post-witching close and Monday’s pre-holiday flow.",

      "title": "NBIS is a steal at this price, change my mind",
      "content": "NBIS is a steal at this price, change my mind\n\nI’m currently averaged at $96 on Nebius and I definitely wish I’d waited a bit longer to build my position. At these levels though, I genuinely think the stock is massively undervalued. A lot of the recent decline feels driven by bad sentiment driven by bad sentiment and a broader sell off after Oracle’s earnings. At current pricing, this looks like one of the biggest steals in the market to me.\n\nHere's why:   \n\n\n**- AI compute is structurally undersupplied.** \n\nThis is not a short cycle issue. Training and inference demand keeps growing faster than GPU supply, power availability and data center capacity. Companies that can actually deliver large scale GPU clusters with power and networking are the bottleneck.\n\nNebius sits right in that bottleneck.\n\n  \n**- Hyperscaler validation matters more than narratives**  \nMicrosoft signed up to $19.4B in multi year GPU capacity. Meta followed with another $3B. These are not pilot projects or optional experiments. This is mission critical infrastructure.\n\nIf Microsoft and Meta are willing to rely on Nebius for AI compute, the tech works and the execution bar has already been cleared at a very high level.\n\n  \n\\- **Extreme growth**   \nQ3 revenue was up 355% YoY.  \nARR today is roughly $550M and guided to ramp to $7–9B by the end of 2026 as contracted capacity comes online.  \nAI operations are already EBITDA positive with margins around 20%.\n\n**- Capex is not the problem people think it is**  \nYes, capex is massive. That is the business. But Nebius is sitting on roughly $5B in cash and raised convertibles at extremely low interest rates. Capital markets are clearly comfortable financing this growth because the demand is locked in by secured deals.\n\n  \n**- This is the most important one, everyone keeps forgetting the extra assets they own besides the cloud business**   \nMost people talk about Nebius as if it’s just an AI cloud provider. That’s missing a big part of the picture.\n\nOn top of the cloud business, Nebius still owns several assets that have real value and are basically being priced at a huge discount or in my opinion even close to zero (!!) by the market right now.\n\nAvride ($2-3B valuation) is now partnered with Uber. Avride is working with Uber on delivery robots, which is a massive market on its own.\n\nThen there’s TripleTen ($300-500M)growing fast in a high margin digital space\n\nOn top of that, Nebius still has stakes in things like AI data annotation and database tech through Toloka and ClickHouse ($2B) . These aren’t random side projects, they sit right in the AI value chain and have raised at serious private valuations in the past.\n\nIf you do even conservative sum of the parts math, you’re talking about several billion in value outside of the core cloud business. Right now, the market seems to be valuing Nebius almost purely as “AI cloud plus execution risk” and ignoring everything else. \n\nIf Nebius actually hits the target of  $7–9B ARR in 2026, you’re looking at a forward revenue multiple of roughly 2.4x for the core cloud business. While others easily have a multiple of 5-10. \n\n**- The real risks**  \nI don't want to turn a blind eye to the risk, because ofc there are:   \n\\- Data center build timelines slipping  \n\\- Customer concentration  \n\\- Share dilution over time\n\nAll real. But they are execution risks, not demand risks. Chance of execution is (in my opinion) the highest at Nebius compared to others, because of their former Yandex experience.   \n  \nThis all seems to good to be true to me, so please convince me if i'm missing something here. Even a base case should provide a valuation of roughly 120-150$ according to my research. \n\n\n\n",

      "content": "NBIS; An Opportunity To Be A Generational Bag Holder\n\nHere is a company whose core business revolves around purchasing costly depreciating GPUs and renting their output out to hyper scalers such as Microsoft at a loss.\n\nTheir subsidiaries are arguably nothing but money-sinks (Clickhouse, AVride, etc.) and are outclassed by numerous competitors such as Snowflake, Starship Technologies, etc.\n\nWhile Revenue has grown 300%+ year over year, expenses have grown at a faster rate and the company is essentially burning through money.\n\n1. Secure a contract at a loss -&gt; \n\n2. Use contract to get a loan/funding -&gt; \n\n3. Build out infrastructure/acquire GPUs -&gt; \n\n4. Repeat -&gt; \n\n5. Hope to eventually become a competing AWS alternative for AI cloud solutions.\n\nThe problem: \n\nToday, the overwhelming majority of NBIS's revenue comes from hyper scalers looking to offload demand. NBIS is providing them the compute at a loss. \n\nAt anytime a hyperscaler(s) can choose to no longer use NBIS when unfavorable, which will completely cripple the company's finances.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are currently investing extremely heavily into their own data centers to keep up with demand, so the chance of Nebius acquiring customers that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, can't provide supply to in the future is low.\n\nThere is also huge uncertainty regarding NBIS's future cashflows, demand, and financial solvency. Shareholders may unknowingly be diluted to raise funds, a forced buy-out can happen, etc.\n\nOverall, NBIS is a great opportunity to become a generational bag holder. Simply ignore the financials and choose to invest off of vibes, chasing hype, etc., and you may potentially find yourself holding a bag for years to come.",

      "content": "With all the bubble talk, here's some optimistic data\n\nI'm not going to lie, I'm a little uneasy about this market. P/E ratio is high. Unemployment rate is rising. Stocks have been pretty weak in Q4. High beta stocks have gotten demolished. Buffet's cash pile is at an ATH. Aswath Damodaran is suggesting investors buy collectibles to diversify. The S&amp;P has returned over 20% two years in a row followed by \\~15% so far in '25. There's concerns over Oracle's debt, OpenAI making commitments they can't keep, circular deals, many people even believe we're in a full on bubble.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to point out some data that may make you rethink selling out of your stocks and going to cash.\n\n1. There have only been four years since 1938 where the S&amp;P 500 total return was -18% or worse. 1974, 2002, 2008, and 2022. So 4/87 years. Yes, 18% is somewhat cherry picked and of course cumulative peak to trough drawdowns have been much worse than 18%. But if you bought on the close of the last day of the trading year, you only lost 18% or more over the next 12 months 4.6% of the time.\n2. The S&amp;P 500 PEG ratio is currently 1.2 which is roughly about average since 1995. It was above 1.6 in 2016. Above 1.5 in 2004. And above 1.4 for much of the 2010s. It even got to 2.0 in 2023 but quickly reversed.\n3. The stock market has gone many years without a red total return year several times. Some notable stretches. 2009-2017. 1991-1999. 1982-1989. 1947-1952. So just because we've had three years of strong gains doesn't mean the bull market has to end here and come crashing down.\n4. The trailing P/E of the S&amp;P 500 is being obfuscated by a few highly weighted stocks with abnormal growth rates. Namely Nvidia, which has a 42x trailing P/E but a 22.5x forward P/E. Historically, the largest stocks in the market usually grew at 3-4% per year.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't good reasons to be bearish. I'm not saying that 2026 is going to be a great year. I'm not even saying that you shouldn't reduce risk or that going to cash won't be the right move in hindsight. I'm just trying to provide some balance to the current uneasy feeling many of us have. Earnings growth has been strong, AI could really improve GDP over the next 5-10 years, margins have been steadily increasing for a long time, and interest rates are coming down.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/](https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/)\n\n[https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns)",

      "content": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector\n\nA few weeks ago I saw an interesting post here about the [energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pbgprq/energy_stocks_are_still_cheap_and_nobody_seems_to/) sector. The basic idea was straightforward:\n\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data center capacity planned over the next five years, and data centers are extreme power consumers. In the U.S., a large share of power generation still comes from hydrocarbons, especially natural gas. Companies that provide that energy appear to be overlooked.\n\nWhat that post didn’t get into was a deeper dive into the energy companies themselves — specifically, which ones might actually offer attractive opportunities today.\n\nSo I decided to do that. I used a tool I built that ingests SEC filings for each company and supplements them with industry data from:\n\n* American Petroleum Institute\n* U.S. Energy Information Administration\n* American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers\n* Society of Petroleum Engineers\n* Journal of Petroleum Technology\n* World Oil\n* Oil and Gas Journal\n* Hydrocarbon Processing\n\nI produced 10+ reports across different energy companies. After going through all of them, the companies that stood out to me were:\n\n* [Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/BjArBLK0WHRj) – this was the most interesting to me given that it generated \\~$8.1B of TTM free cash flow in 2024 on a \\~$73B market cap (a mid-teens FCF yield if sustained), while the stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months (+0.9%). It trades at \\~7x EV/EBITDA and \\~12x TTM EPS, despite controlling \\~20.1B boe of long-life 2P oil sands reserves and producing \\~1.36M boe/d. The valuation appears to reflect market skepticism around long-duration durability and Canadian policy risk more than near-term cash generation.\n* [Matador Resources (MTDR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/eXS9JPBjEbOK) – MTDR stood out because balance-sheet stress is not evident in the current numbers: net debt sits below \\~1x EBITDA, production continues to grow in the Delaware Basin, and the company owns majority-interest, largely fee-based midstream assets (San Mateo / Pronto) that support cash-flow stability. Despite this, the stock trades around \\~3x EV/EBITDA, a multiple more commonly associated with higher leverage or structurally challenged E&amp;Ps.\n* [Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/YDjQ0bF0lQjM) – In contrast to the commodity-exposed producers, EPD’s appeal is the consistency of its cash generation: operating cash flow has stayed above \\~$7.5B annually since 2021, distribution coverage has run \\~1.6–1.7x, and the partnership retained \\~$3.24B in 2024 after distributions. Units trade around \\~7.5x EV/EBITDA despite this level of cash-flow stability and balance-sheet strength.\n\nI’m also sharing the reports for the other companies I analyzed in case anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [CHEVRON CORP (CVX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/dPtgVsyaOVZt)\n* [ANTERO RESOURCES Corp (AR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/IDhlgnNAdAUB)\n* [AEMETIS, INC (AMTX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/qWCT1bsvIyDj)\n* [NextDecade Corp (NEXT)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/JJZlaAD3JrFK)\n* [AMEREN CORP (AEE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/bz6cvzIIw5KP)\n* [SM Energy Co (SM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/2rQK36fGNwaD)\n* [Crescent Energy Co (CRGY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/DDSGWbDUlote)\n* [EXXON MOBIL CORP (XOM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/p9Lzg0rb1qKZ)\n* [OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP (OXY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/8ZSEPD2k7oDk)\n* [Vital Energy, Inc. (VTLE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/sYfs8N4YJHVR)\n* [WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. (WMB)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/z2j2kNtxUEXR)\n\nCusious to hear which energy stocks others here are following. Any interesting ones I missed?",

Polymarket is currently pricing in a 98% probability, which tells you how one-sided positioning has become.\nIf the BOJ does hike, the immediate reaction is pretty predictable:\nyen strength, pressure on Japanese equities, and likely some spillover volatility across global markets. Historically, BOJ tightening has caused short-term dips before things stabilize  sometimes even setting up a decent bottom once the event risk clears. That said, with expectations this high, the bigger question might be how much of this move is already priced in. A hike could still cause turbulence, but a surprise hold would be even more disruptive given current positioning.\nCurious to see how others are positioning into this hedge, stay flat, or trade the post-decision reaction?",

I locked up about $10,000 worth of BTC and borrowed $5,500 cash. The app called that “55% LTV”. All it means is: loan divided by collateral value.\n\nThe terms said a warning would hit around 70% and an auto-sell could happen around 80%. I read it, nodded, and moved on. Big mistake. Because the math changes fast when price drops.\n\nThat night BTC slid hard. My $10,000 collateral became roughly $7,800 in a few hours. My loan was still $5,500, so my LTV jumped to about 70%+. I got a message: “margin call, 24 hours to cure.” Cure means add more collateral or repay part of the loan.\n\nI tried adding $1,000 more BTC from another wallet. Network fees were spiking and my transfer sat pending. I tried repaying $500 instead, but my bank transfer wouldn’t clear instantly. Support chat replied like “high volume, expect delays.” The timer didn’t care.\n\nBy morning the app showed “partial liquidation executed.” They sold a chunk of my BTC to push the ratio back down, then charged an execution fee on what they sold. I wasn’t wiped out, but I did sell at the worst moment without choosing to.\n\nIf you ever use these loans, assume a 30% drop can happen any random day. Borrow lower than you think, keep extra collateral ready, and make sure you can move money fast.",

      "content": "What’s the best lesson you have learned in 2025?\n\nAs we near the end of 2025, I’ve been thinking a lot about how this year has played out for me as an investor. Between the ups and downs of the AI hype cycle, the volatility in crypto, and the broader market swings, I’ve had to adjust my strategy more than once.\n\nIf I had to pick one lesson that stood out, it would be this: I really underestimated the importance of cash management and balanced allocation. There were times I was too aggressive or too concentrated, and it hurt. Looking back, I wish I had focused more on building a portfolio that is steady over the long term but flexible enough to adapt when needed.\n\nCurious to hear from others. What was the most important lesson you learned this year, whether it’s about strategy, mindset, or a specific event that changed your thinking?",

Deadlines start slipping. A team that used to be fast suddenly moves slower.  \nBudgets stretch further than expected. Meetings multiply without producing decisions. Leaders start sensing friction but theyre not sure where it’s coming from. Is it workload imbalance?  A manager overwhelmed? A team operating without clarity? Resources being allocated the wrong way? Or something deeper, like burnout creeping through an entire department? The truth is inefficiency rarely announces itself. It builds quietly, hidden inside tools, systems, and processes that no one has time to examine. By the time the symptoms are loud enough for executives to notice, the problem has already become expensive. HR is expected to diagnose these issues yet theyre asked to do it without the one thing that would make it possible: connected, clear data. You cant fix what you cant see and most inefficiencies stay invisible far longer than they should and HR AI solutions are needed!!",

      "content": "Not overreacting to the NVDA insider sale\n\nNvidia director Harvey Jones sold about 250,000 shares around $177 for roughly $44M. These were shares he’s held for decades, and he still controls over 7M shares through a trust, so I read this as long term trimming more than a confidence signal turning negative. (News source if you’re interested: Nvidia Executives Sell Over $41 Million in Stock)For me, the headline only matters if it lines up with the chart. NVDA is in a pretty defined zone and the $177 to $180 area is the near term pivot. That’s roughly where the sale happened, and it has also been a tough area for the stock to push through lately. If NVDA can reclaim $180 and stay above it for a few closes, it’s basically the market saying it does not care about the insider headline.On the downside, I’m watching $169 to $171 as first support. If that breaks cleanly, the next likely stop is the mid $160s, around $165 to $160. Below that, you’re probably looking at the low $150s, and that usually needs a broader market wobble or a real shift in the AI narrative. This is also why I’m not overreacting to the insider sale by itself. Big, long held positions get trimmed all the time. Without a real break in price or a clear change in demand signals, it’s not enough for me to call a top.",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-18 08:02:08 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n### 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Bearish with Elevated Retail Skepticism**\nThe data points to a **bearish tilt** in overall sentiment, driven by a confluence of negative catalysts and a clear shift in retail trader psychology.\n*   **Reddit Sentiment:** Dominated by themes of loss (\"exit liquidity,\" \"rate my bags\"), sharp declines in major tech/AI names (NVDA, ORCL, ASML), and political/economic skepticism. The high engagement on these negative posts indicates a frustrated and risk-off retail cohort.\n*   **Macro & Policy Backdrop:** The end of the ECB rate cut cycle signals a global shift towards a \"higher-for-longer\" reality, tightening financial conditions. The elevated VIX (17.62) and 10Y Yield (4.15%) confirm ongoing market anxiety.\n*   **Contrarian Note:** The single-day bounce in NVDA (+2.54%) per FMP data against a backdrop of severe recent decline suggests potential for a technical rebound or short squeeze, but this does not outweigh the broader negative narrative.\n\n### 2. KEY THEMES: **AI Reckoning, Political Volatility, and Retail Disillusionment**\n*   **AI/ Tech Growth Re-evaluation:** A dominant theme. Reddit discusses the \"AI Infrastructure\" trade unwinding (ORCL, NVDA, ASML), while news of China's reported EUV breakthrough threatens a key moat in the semiconductor supply chain. This is a fundamental shift from growth-at-any-price to scrutiny of debt, execution, and valuation.\n*   **Political & Policy Uncertainty:** Trump-related topics (tariffs, military dividends, DJT merger, job data debates) are pervasive, indicating markets are pricing in event risk and potential fiscal/monetary policy shifts. The record beef price despite pressure highlights persistent inflationary pressures.\n*   **Retail Capitulation & Meme Nostalgia:** Sentiment is shifting from speculative greed to defensive realism (\"took profits... paid cash for a Honda\"). Posts about delisted pennies and GameStop activity (+3.34%) reflect a search for familiar, albeit high-risk, catalysts in a difficult market. The \"gamma nightmare\" discussion shows retail is aware of its impact but feels scapegoated.\n*   **Monetary Policy Pivot Completion:** The ECB signaling the end of its rate cut cycle (Bloomberg) is a critical macro theme, suggesting the era of easy policy support is decisively over.\n\n### 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n*   **Immediate Negative Catalysts:**\n    1.  **ORCL & ASML Earnings Shock:** Specific reports of AI data center snags and technological competition are driving sharp, fundamental re-ratings.\n    2.  **NVDA Breakdown:** A >20% drop in 45 days is a major technical and psychological breach, threatening broader market sentiment.\n    3.  **Policy Support Withdrawal:** ECB's stance is a clear signal to global equity markets.\n*   **Potential Volatility Catalysts:**\n    1.  **DJT / TAE Merger:** A $6B deal for a speculative fusion company is a high-profile, sentiment-driven event that could drain liquidity from other speculative assets.\n    2.  **FTC Investigation:** News of an FTC probe into Instacart's parent indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny on consumer tech.\n    3.  **Caroline Ellison Release:** A reminder of the crypto/leveraged speculation era, potentially stirring volatility in related assets.\n\n### 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Sector Rotation Risk:** A violent unwind of the crowded AI/tech trade. This is the most immediate systemic risk to equity portfolios.\n    2.  **Liquidity Risk:** As seen in the muni hedge fund (Whitehaven) returning cash, liquidity is being pulled from riskier segments. Retail disillusionment compounds this.\n    3.  **Idiosyncratic Political Risk:** Market-moving announcements (tariffs, fiscal stimulus) are becoming more frequent and unpredictable, increasing headline volatility.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Technical Bounces:** Heavily sold mega-caps like **NVDA** may see fierce but likely short-lived rallies (e.g., the +2.54% move). These are trading, not investing, opportunities.\n    2.  **Defensive & Staple Sectors:** Record beef prices and persistent inflation highlight pricing power in **Consumer Staples**.\n    3.  **Volatility Harvesting:** Elevated VIX and market anxiety present opportunities in defined-risk options strategies for experienced traders.\n\n### 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n**WATCH / CONSIDER:**\n*   **NVDA:** Monitor the $175 level closely. Today's bounce is a counter-trend move within a severe downtrend. Any failure to hold gains confirms bearish momentum. **Only for tactical traders.**\n*   **SECTOR: Semiconductors (SMH/SOX):** Under severe pressure from both fundamental (ORCL, ASML news) and technical breakdowns. Avoid catching the falling knife. Wait for a consolidation pattern to form.\n*   **SECTOR: Consumer Staples (XLP):** A relative safe haven amid growth stock turmoil and persistent inflation (see beef prices). Offers defensive rotation potential.\n*   **DJT:** Pure sentiment and volatility play. The TAE merger is a high-risk, speculative event. Treat any exposure as a lottery ticket, not an investment.\n*   **VIX:** Levels near 18 indicate sustained fear. A spike above 20 would signal an escalation to panic, likely triggering a broader market sell-off. A key gauge for portfolio risk management.\n*   **GME:** The +3.34% move on low news is a signature of meme-stock nostalgia liquidity. It acts as a **canary in the coal mine for speculative retail risk appetite**—its failure would signal full retail retreat.\n\n---\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market is in a **risk-off corrective phase**, led by a breakdown in the previous AI leadership. Retail sentiment has turned defensive/skeptical. The primary action is **capital preservation**: reduce exposure to high-multiple growth/tech, raise cash, and rotate into defensives. Wait for volatility to subside and new leadership to emerge before committing significant capital to the long side. Trade counter-trend bounces with tight risk controls.",

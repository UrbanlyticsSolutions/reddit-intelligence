Strange is that I couldn't find another year that happened. Probably because it's nearly impossible to have increasing production month after month after month. (Please correct me if I'm wrong)\n\nHere is the data:  \n[https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=M](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=M)\n\nDallas Fed Energy Survey Dec 17, 2025 where the quote was taken.

Secure a contract at a loss -&gt; \n\n2. Use contract to get a loan/funding -&gt; \n\n3. Build out infrastructure/acquire GPUs -&gt; \n\n4. Repeat -&gt; \n\n5. Hope to eventually become a competing AWS alternative for AI cloud solutions.\n\nThe problem: \n\nToday, the overwhelming majority of NBIS's revenue comes from hyper scalers looking to offload demand. NBIS is providing them the compute at a loss. \n\nAt anytime a hyperscaler(s) can choose to no longer use NBIS when unfavorable, which will completely cripple the company's finances.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are currently investing extremely heavily into their own data centers to keep up with demand, so the chance of Nebius acquiring customers that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, can't provide supply to in the future is low.\n\nThere is also huge uncertainty regarding NBIS's future cashflows, demand, and financial solvency. Shareholders may unknowingly be diluted to raise funds, a forced buy-out can happen, etc.\n\nOverall, NBIS is a great opportunity to become a generational bag holder. Simply ignore the financials and choose to invest off of vibes, chasing hype, etc., and you may potentially find yourself holding a bag for years to come.",

      "content": "The first time I used a crypto-backed loan.... it felt like cheating.\n\nLast winter I tried a crypto-backed loan because I didn’t want to sell my coins. I locked up about $10,000 worth of BTC and borrowed $5,500 cash. The app called that “55% LTV”. All it means is: loan divided by collateral value.\n\nThe terms said a warning would hit around 70% and an auto-sell could happen around 80%. I read it, nodded, and moved on. Big mistake. Because the math changes fast when price drops.\n\nThat night BTC slid hard. My $10,000 collateral became roughly $7,800 in a few hours. My loan was still $5,500, so my LTV jumped to about 70%+. I got a message: “margin call, 24 hours to cure.” Cure means add more collateral or repay part of the loan.\n\nI tried adding $1,000 more BTC from another wallet. Network fees were spiking and my transfer sat pending. I tried repaying $500 instead, but my bank transfer wouldn’t clear instantly. Support chat replied like “high volume, expect delays.” The timer didn’t care.\n\nBy morning the app showed “partial liquidation executed.” They sold a chunk of my BTC to push the ratio back down, then charged an execution fee on what they sold. I wasn’t wiped out, but I did sell at the worst moment without choosing to.\n\nIf you ever use these loans, assume a 30% drop can happen any random day. Borrow lower than you think, keep extra collateral ready, and make sure you can move money fast.",

      "content": "With all the bubble talk, here's some optimistic data\n\nI'm not going to lie, I'm a little uneasy about this market. P/E ratio is high. Unemployment rate is rising. Stocks have been pretty weak in Q4. High beta stocks have gotten demolished. Buffet's cash pile is at an ATH. Aswath Damodaran is suggesting investors buy collectibles to diversify. The S&amp;P has returned over 20% two years in a row followed by \\~15% so far in '25. There's concerns over Oracle's debt, OpenAI making commitments they can't keep, circular deals, many people even believe we're in a full on bubble.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to point out some data that may make you rethink selling out of your stocks and going to cash.\n\n1. There have only been four years since 1938 where the S&amp;P 500 total return was -18% or worse. 1974, 2002, 2008, and 2022. So 4/87 years. Yes, 18% is somewhat cherry picked and of course cumulative peak to trough drawdowns have been much worse than 18%. But if you bought on the close of the last day of the trading year, you only lost 18% or more over the next 12 months 4.6% of the time.\n2. The S&amp;P 500 PEG ratio is currently 1.2 which is roughly about average since 1995. It was above 1.6 in 2016. Above 1.5 in 2004. And above 1.4 for much of the 2010s. It even got to 2.0 in 2023 but quickly reversed.\n3. The stock market has gone many years without a red total return year several times. Some notable stretches. 2009-2017. 1991-1999. 1982-1989. 1947-1952. So just because we've had three years of strong gains doesn't mean the bull market has to end here and come crashing down.\n4. The trailing P/E of the S&amp;P 500 is being obfuscated by a few highly weighted stocks with abnormal growth rates. Namely Nvidia, which has a 42x trailing P/E but a 22.5x forward P/E. Historically, the largest stocks in the market usually grew at 3-4% per year.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't good reasons to be bearish. I'm not saying that 2026 is going to be a great year. I'm not even saying that you shouldn't reduce risk or that going to cash won't be the right move in hindsight. I'm just trying to provide some balance to the current uneasy feeling many of us have. Earnings growth has been strong, AI could really improve GDP over the next 5-10 years, margins have been steadily increasing for a long time, and interest rates are coming down.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/](https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/)\n\n[https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns)",

      "title": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector",
      "content": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector\n\nA few weeks ago I saw an interesting post here about the [energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pbgprq/energy_stocks_are_still_cheap_and_nobody_seems_to/) sector. The basic idea was straightforward:\n\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data center capacity planned over the next five years, and data centers are extreme power consumers. In the U.S., a large share of power generation still comes from hydrocarbons, especially natural gas. Companies that provide that energy appear to be overlooked.\n\nWhat that post didn’t get into was a deeper dive into the energy companies themselves — specifically, which ones might actually offer attractive opportunities today.\n\nSo I decided to do that. I used a tool I built that ingests SEC filings for each company and supplements them with industry data from:\n\n* American Petroleum Institute\n* U.S. Energy Information Administration\n* American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers\n* Society of Petroleum Engineers\n* Journal of Petroleum Technology\n* World Oil\n* Oil and Gas Journal\n* Hydrocarbon Processing\n\nI produced 10+ reports across different energy companies. After going through all of them, the companies that stood out to me were:\n\n* [Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/BjArBLK0WHRj) – this was the most interesting to me given that it generated \\~$8.1B of TTM free cash flow in 2024 on a \\~$73B market cap (a mid-teens FCF yield if sustained), while the stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months (+0.9%). It trades at \\~7x EV/EBITDA and \\~12x TTM EPS, despite controlling \\~20.1B boe of long-life 2P oil sands reserves and producing \\~1.36M boe/d. The valuation appears to reflect market skepticism around long-duration durability and Canadian policy risk more than near-term cash generation.\n* [Matador Resources (MTDR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/eXS9JPBjEbOK) – MTDR stood out because balance-sheet stress is not evident in the current numbers: net debt sits below \\~1x EBITDA, production continues to grow in the Delaware Basin, and the company owns majority-interest, largely fee-based midstream assets (San Mateo / Pronto) that support cash-flow stability. Despite this, the stock trades around \\~3x EV/EBITDA, a multiple more commonly associated with higher leverage or structurally challenged E&amp;Ps.\n* [Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/YDjQ0bF0lQjM) – In contrast to the commodity-exposed producers, EPD’s appeal is the consistency of its cash generation: operating cash flow has stayed above \\~$7.5B annually since 2021, distribution coverage has run \\~1.6–1.7x, and the partnership retained \\~$3.24B in 2024 after distributions. Units trade around \\~7.5x EV/EBITDA despite this level of cash-flow stability and balance-sheet strength.\n\nI’m also sharing the reports for the other companies I analyzed in case anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [CHEVRON CORP (CVX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/dPtgVsyaOVZt)\n* [ANTERO RESOURCES Corp (AR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/IDhlgnNAdAUB)\n* [AEMETIS, INC (AMTX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/qWCT1bsvIyDj)\n* [NextDecade Corp (NEXT)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/JJZlaAD3JrFK)\n* [AMEREN CORP (AEE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/bz6cvzIIw5KP)\n* [SM Energy Co (SM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/2rQK36fGNwaD)\n* [Crescent Energy Co (CRGY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/DDSGWbDUlote)\n* [EXXON MOBIL CORP (XOM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/p9Lzg0rb1qKZ)\n* [OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP (OXY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/8ZSEPD2k7oDk)\n* [Vital Energy, Inc. (VTLE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/sYfs8N4YJHVR)\n* [WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. (WMB)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/z2j2kNtxUEXR)\n\nCusious to hear which energy stocks others here are following. Any interesting ones I missed?",

Historically, the Sahm indicator has been used as a confirmation tool for \"recession\" (I use quotes because I feel the term has become more and more ambiguous in recent years) and is a measure of how unemployment is trending.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the Sahm indicator--It looks at the unemployment moving average.  Fundamentally, it takes a look at the lowest 3-month moving average over a 12-month period (currently about \\~4.2%) and compares it to the most recent 3-month moving average.  Essentially, if the current 3-month moving average is .50% (50 bps) higher than the 3-month moving average low, it produces a confirmation signal of \"recession\" with no historical false positives. \n\nThe current moving average of unemployment is \\~4.43% which puts us north of 20 bps toward the signal.  If the January 9th print is anything higher than 4.7%, there will be real concerns about the state of the economy (will put unemployment moving average at about \\~40 bps above  the moving average low).  As of today's (12/17) price action, it looks like the market is pricing in the possibility of an accelerating unemployment trend that could continue in January's print.  The Fed recently cut rates which may help reduce firing rates as cost saving measures, but January's unemployment print will be critical in understanding where the economy is at and likely where the stock market will go next.  \n\nTL;DR--If unemployment print on 1/9/26 &gt;4.7%, risk off.  If less than, likely a neutral to risk on shift.  ",

I've got my 401k and an emergency fund set, so now I'm looking to open a brokerage account for some growth oriented investing. I know trying to time the market is a fool's game, so I'm more interested in finding companies I believe in for the next few years.\n\nAll the hype seems to be about AI and semiconductors right now, and the prices reflect that. It feels a bit frothy. I'm trying to look past the current trends and think about what might be a good buy for 2026 and beyond. I keep seeing lists for the \"best growth stocks 2026\" but they all just seem to list the same mega cap tech companies.\n\nI'm not afraid of some risk, but I also don't want to just chase what's already shot up. I'm interested in sectors that might be overlooked now but have solid long term potential.\n\nHow do you even begin to research a company for a 3-5 year time horizon instead of just quarterly earnings?  \nAre there sectors you think are undervalued right now that could be strong contenders for the best growth stocks 2026?  \nHow much does current Fed policy and interest rates play into your long term stock picks?\n\nI'm not looking for specific tickers, more like a framework for how to think about this. If anyone has resources or a strategy they use for finding longer-term growth opportunities, I'd really appreciate it.",

      "content": "A Survey of writings on the AI bubble\n\nThere's been a lot of diverging view points on whether we're in an AI bubble (even this week there was some drama with Oracle and Blue Owl). \n\nI wanted to [share my on thoughts](https://eastwind.substack.com/p/power-overwhelming) &amp; learnings from reading a lot of things on the internet:\n\n* My own takeaways from looking at a bunch of data, which I wrote in my [blog](https://eastwind.substack.com/p/power-overwhelming).\n* Scour the internet for other popular writings that the capture the current \"zeitgeist\". \n\nMy takeaways (from looking at tech companies, VC funding , data center depreciation vs. traditional data centers) are the following:\n\n* We're fine from a fundamentals perspective, at least for the first half of 2026 (AI revenues are growing, models are improving, categories like coding are delivering ROI)\n* If there's a crash, it will be due to sentiment, or if OpenAI / Anthropic miss their revenue projections\n* There are concerns around quality of revenues + ROI for specific industries. We see this both at public companies like Salesforce (with Agentforce) as well as startups.\n* Specific categories of SaaS will not be disrupted by AI in the medium term &amp; SaaS overall is pretty beaten down so those companies will rerate. Some software infra companies give indirect exposure to AI startups (e.g. OpenAI spends a ton on Datadog) \n* There might be a big revenue hole once current capex comes online in 2027/2028. But right now we're generating tokens from the capex from 2021-2024, and relative to capex from those years we're ok\n* AI SaaS revenues + OpenAI / Anthropic revenue growth can't justify capex. Big Tech's internal workloads (e.g. Meta / Google using AI for better ad targeting) matter way more (e.g. better ad targeting, Google serving inference workloads from AI overviews, etc.)\n* Current depreciation schedules (6 years for GPUs) don't make sense at all\n\n  \nAnd some learnings from my readings (some links) don't have notes because as they didn't provide things that were net new information):\n\n[*Can the AI Boom Pay for Itself?*](https://www.thetimes.blog/p/can-the-ai-boom-pay-for-itself)\n\n* If tokens generated increase \\~9-12% monthly (for inference), then we're on track to meet capex. The author does think we're in a phase of overbuild, however.\n\n  \n[*Sam Altman’s Dirty DRAM Deal*](https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/sam-altman-s-dirty-dram-deal) \n\n* The current memory price spike is due to two simultaneous deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for 40% of the world's DRAM supply. This basically triggered a panic buying from everyone else\n\n[*Is It a Bubble?*](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/is-it-a-bubble) *(Oaktree Captial)* \n\n* Companies that usher in a game-changing technology are not necessarily the beneficiaries of said technology (e.g. auto companies).\n\n  \n[*Is AI a bubble?*](https://www.exponentialview.co/p/is-ai-a-bubble)\n\n* Uses 5 gauges to measure signs of an AI bubble: economic strain (capex / GDP), industry strain (investment / revenue), revenue growth (revenue doubling time), valuation heat (PE ratio), and funding quality. When two of the gauges are red, it means we are in trouble\n* Right now, industry strain is approaching red, economic strain and valuation heat is approaching yellow\n\n  \n[*Thoughts on the AI buildout*](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/thoughts-on-the-ai-buildout)\n\n* Curtailment (whereby data centers voluntarily shut down during peak periods) will unlock 76GW of additional power because you need to build less peak power\n\n[*Surviving the AI Capex Boom*](https://www.sparklinecapital.com/post/surviving-the-ai-capex-boom)\n\n* More of a macro piece. Looking back at history companies with high asset growth had a tendency to underperform.

The author states that based on this number, OAI’s “implied” revenue is significantly lower than OAI’s publicly stated revenue numbers\n* If this accusation is true, OpenAI revenues are far below what has been publicly reported. There are several explanations for this (one of the reasons is Microsoft also resells OpenAI’s APIs, in which case OAI would capture some %), so the number here could be net payments.\n\n[*The Case Against Generative AI*](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-case-against-generative-ai/)\n\n* Concerns revolve around the current AI revenues (author estimates it to be $61B) vs. capex and AI margins\n* My take is that the author has not accounted for the pace of revenue growth (which was $0 a few years ago) nor big tech’s internal workloads (Meta serving better ads).\n* Not accounting for the shift towards cheaper open-source models (e.g. Airbnb using Qwen models)\n* Doesn’t account for the lag from capex vs. revenue.

Between the ups and downs of the AI hype cycle, the volatility in crypto, and the broader market swings, I’ve had to adjust my strategy more than once.\n\nIf I had to pick one lesson that stood out, it would be this: I really underestimated the importance of cash management and balanced allocation. There were times I was too aggressive or too concentrated, and it hurt. Looking back, I wish I had focused more on building a portfolio that is steady over the long term but flexible enough to adapt when needed.\n\nCurious to hear from others.

Polymarket is currently pricing in a 98% probability, which tells you how one-sided positioning has become.\nIf the BOJ does hike, the immediate reaction is pretty predictable:\nyen strength, pressure on Japanese equities, and likely some spillover volatility across global markets. Historically, BOJ tightening has caused short-term dips before things stabilize  sometimes even setting up a decent bottom once the event risk clears. That said, with expectations this high, the bigger question might be how much of this move is already priced in. A hike could still cause turbulence, but a surprise hold would be even more disruptive given current positioning.\nCurious to see how others are positioning into this hedge, stay flat, or trade the post-decision reaction?",

Recent inflation data has given tech stocks some breathing room, while Micron Technology’s strong earnings report added fuel to the rebound. Still, concerns remain about China’s aggressive push into AI infrastructure and semiconductors, which could challenge Nvidia’s long term positioning.\n\n* **Market Rebound**: The Nasdaq has bounced back thanks to favorable inflation numbers, creating a more positive environment for Nvidia and other tech names.\n* **Micron’s Impact**: Micron jumped 9.3% after earnings, which could help boost confidence across the sector, including Nvidia.\n* **China’s AI Push**: Heavy investment from China in AI and chip technology is a looming risk that Nvidia can’t ignore.\n\nOverall, Nvidia is benefiting from short term tailwinds but still faces big structural challenges. Curious how others here are positioning, do you see the rebound as sustainable, or just another temporary lift before competition and macro pressures weigh in again?",

Deadlines start slipping. A team that used to be fast suddenly moves slower.  \nBudgets stretch further than expected. Meetings multiply without producing decisions. Leaders start sensing friction but theyre not sure where it’s coming from. Is it workload imbalance?  A manager overwhelmed? A team operating without clarity? Resources being allocated the wrong way? Or something deeper, like burnout creeping through an entire department? The truth is inefficiency rarely announces itself. It builds quietly, hidden inside tools, systems, and processes that no one has time to examine. By the time the symptoms are loud enough for executives to notice, the problem has already become expensive. HR is expected to diagnose these issues yet theyre asked to do it without the one thing that would make it possible: connected, clear data. You cant fix what you cant see and most inefficiencies stay invisible far longer than they should and HR AI solutions are needed!!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-18 10:01:56 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **BEARISH WITH SPECULATIVE POCKETS**\nThe overall sentiment is bearish, driven by:\n- **Retail disillusionment:** Reddit's top post highlights \"exit liquidity\" and bag-holding in AI, indicating retail capitulation.\n- **Macroeconomic anxiety:** Elevated CPI (2.7%), high unemployment (4.6%), and discussions of \"poverty, not wealth\" suggest underlying economic strain.\n- **VIX elevated at 17.62** confirms heightened near-term uncertainty.\n- **Contrasting signal:** NVDA up 2.49% in FMP data suggests potential technical bounce or short covering in a beaten-down sector, but this does not outweigh broader negative sentiment.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES\n- **AI Sector Reckoning:** Dominant theme. Reddit discusses NVDA's >20% drop and \"AI Infrastructure\" as exit liquidity. Bloomberg notes \"Another Big Shift in the AI Vibes.\" This signals a narrative shift from unbridled optimism to valuation scrutiny.\n- **Political & Policy Uncertainty:** Trump-related topics (tariffs, Trump Media merger, job growth critique) are prominent, creating policy uncertainty impacting specific sectors (media, trade, manufacturing).\n- **Geopolitical & Tech Tensions:** ASML's 6% dip on China EUV reports and Chevron in Venezuela highlight ongoing tech cold war and energy supply risks.\n- **Market Structure & Speculation:** Discussions on \"gamma nightmare,\" crypto options expiration ($23B), and the bizarre UK GME ticker volume point to ongoing retail-driven volatility and complex derivatives activity.\n- **Macro Data Focus:** December CPI print (2.7%) is a breaking news item, keeping inflation and Fed policy in focus despite the Fed Funds Rate at 3.64%.\n\n## 3. IMPORTANT MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n- **Catalyst:** **CPI Data (2.7%).** Above the Fed's 2% target, but the market reaction will depend on the trajectory and components. This is the immediate macro catalyst.\n- **Signal:** **NVDA Price Action.** Its 2.49% gain today against a 45-day downtrend is a critical signal to watch. A sustained reversal could stabilize tech, while failure may accelerate selling.\n- **Signal:** **ASML's 6% Drop.** A direct signal of market pricing in a potential loss of semiconductor monopoly power, impacting the entire tech hardware sector.\n- **Catalyst:** **Trump Media Merger with TAE Tech ($6B).** A major catalyst for meme stock volatility (DJT +25%) and a signal of continued speculative capital flows into politically-linked assets.\n- **Signal:** **Bitcoin Volatility & $23B Options Expiration.** A significant event for crypto markets, likely to spill over into correlated tech and risk assets.\n\n## 4. PRIMARY RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES\n- **Risks:**\n    1.  **AI Sector Derating:** Risk of a prolonged, fundamental revaluation beyond NVDA to broader software and infrastructure names.\n    2.  **Retail Capitulation:** Sentiment shift from \"buy the dip\" to \"exit liquidity\" can remove a key bid from high-momentum, high-PE stocks.\n    3.  **Political Volatility:** Policy headlines (tariffs, mergers) creating unpredictable, news-driven swings in specific equities.\n    4.  **Geopolitical Tech War:** Acceleration with China's reported EUV breakthrough threatens a core thesis for Western semiconductor equities.\n\n- **Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Contrarian Tech Entry:** If the AI sell-off is a \"price re-evaluation\" and not a broken thesis, current levels may offer a long-term entry point for patient capital.\n    2.  **Defensive & Value Rotation:** High ERP (4.33%) suggests equity market compensation for risk, potentially benefiting value and cash-flow-positive companies (e.g., Renault's upgrade).\n    3.  **Event-Driven Volatility:** Options expirations (Bitcoin) and merger announcements (DJT) create opportunities for tactical traders.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n**Watchlist & Actions:**\n\n- **NVDA:** Monitor the $175 level closely. A failure to hold today's gain confirms the bear trend. A strong close above $180 could signal a temporary bottom and a trading bounce opportunity in semi-conductors (SOXL/SOXS).\n- **SECTOR: Semiconductors (ASML, NVDA, AMD):** High risk. The China EUV news is structurally bearish. Avoid new long positions until the sector shows stabilization. Consider hedging existing exposure.\n- **DJT / Trump Media:** Purely speculative, news-driven vehicle. For traders only. The merger news is likely \"buy the rumor, sell the news.\" Extreme volatility expected; not a fundamental investment.\n- **SECTOR: Defensive / Value:** Favor sectors less tied to AI hype and consumer discretionary spending. The Renault upgrade story highlights market reward for cash flow and credit improvement.\n- **VIX:** Levels near 18 suggest elevated fear but not panic. A spike above 22 would signal a broader market breakdown, triggering de-risking. A drop below 15 would indicate sentiment stabilization.\n- **BITCOIN:** Expect elevated volatility through options expiration. A directional move post-expiry often sets the near-term trend for crypto-correlated assets.\n\n**CONCLUSION:** The market is in a corrective phase led by AI and fueled by macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. Retail sentiment has turned negative, which can be a contrarian indicator at extremes but currently suggests more pain may be ahead. **The immediate playbook is defensive: reduce exposure to high-beta tech, raise cash, and wait for clearer signals of stabilization.** Tactical traders can look for oversold bounces in names like NVDA or volatility plays around DJT, but these are high-risk maneuvers. The CPI print is the key data point for the session.",

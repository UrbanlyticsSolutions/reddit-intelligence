      "content": "Carvana $CVNA is Highly Fraudulent\n\nCredentials:  14 year automotive veteran.  15 year options trader\n\nBullet Points:\n\n1) Carvana’s profit margins are too good to be true.  The best companies in the industry don’t come close to their 19% gross profit margins.  \n\n2) The CEO of Carvana (Ernest Garcia III) Also owns a privately owned auto business named Drivetime.  Drivetime is a dumpster fire.\n\n3) Ernest Garcia III has been funneling his unwanted Carvana inventory to Drivetime to prop up Carvana’s earnings.  Drivetime overpays Carvana for this inventory and then takes the loss on their own balance sheets.\n\n4) Over the last few months Ernest Garcia III has been selling tens of millions of dollars of stock to keep Drivetime afloat\n\n5) Carvana has issued roughly 15.3 million shares over the last year.  At average $330 price this comes to roughly 5 Billion USD.  None of this reflects on the company’s financial report.  \n\nThesis:\n\nBased on CVNA October 2025 earnings report the company’s equity attributed to shareholders increased by 1B usd.\n\nIn the same period the company issued ~15.3 million shares worth over 5B usd.  None of this issuance reflects on the company’s balance sheets.  Healthy companies issue dividends and buy back stock.  Carvana has no dividend and has issued billions in stock solely to their core insiders.\n\nDrivetime (a company owned by Carvana’s CEO) has the worst inventory I have ever seen.  Thousands and thousands of cars that are absolutely overpriced garbage.  Some of the cars they have been sitting on for over 6 months.  \n\nIn October and September of 2025 Ernest Garcia III has sold roughly 82 million dollars of carvana stock.  \n\nI am not a private investigator, financial pro, or accountant, but to me the evidence is compelling that carvana’s results are being directly propped by DRIVETIME and once the Garcias have enriched themselves the real results will emerge.\n\nI plan to open short positions against CVNA in the next few weeks after they fully transition to the SP 500",

      "content": "U.S. uncovers scheme to reroute Nvidia GPUs worth $160 million to China despite export bans\n\nU.S. authorities have detained two Chinese nationals accused of illegally exporting Nvidia chips to China and other restricted destinations. The arrests are part of a wider investigation into what officials say is a network designed to bypass U.S. export controls on advanced technology. Separately, a Houston-based company and its owner have already pleaded guilty to routing Nvidia hardware through shell buyers to evade restrictions. Investigators say the broader probe now involves more than $160 million worth of export-controlled tech. It’s another reminder of how tight controls around AI and high-end chips have become, and how aggressively enforcement is picking up as demand keeps rising.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/us-attorneys-office-southern-district-of-texas-prosecutors-nvidia-chips-h200-h100-smuggle-china.html?__source=androidappshare",

My allocation is 70/20/10 which feels right but the mental clarity from simplifying was honestly the best part, I don't spend hours reading earnings or arguing online anymore, I check everything with blossom now and my returns have been totally fine, just buying more shares monthly and ignoring the noise, nothing crazy but steady…\n\nIf you're on the fence about going full bogle I'd say just do it, the peace of mind is worth more than chasing extra returns",

      "content": "Michael Saylor just pitched countries on creating Bitcoin backed digital banking systems and the concept is pretty wild.\n\nSpeaking in Abu Dhabi, Saylor laid out a vision where countries could use Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit to offer regulated bank accounts that give way higher returns than traditional deposits. He pointed out that banks in Japan, Europe and Switzerland barely pay any interest while US money market funds are around 4%. People are basically disgusted with their bank accounts which is why corporate bonds exist.\n\nHis proposal involves structuring accounts with about 80% digital credit instruments, 20% regular currency, and an extra 10% buffer to reduce volatility. The digital credit layer would be backed by Bitcoin reserves with about 5 to 1 overcollateralization. Basically using Bitcoin as the ultimate collateral layer.\n\nSaylor thinks a country that implements this could attract $20 to $50 trillion in deposits and become the digital banking capital of the world. Thats not a small claim.\n\nHowever theres obvious skepticism here. Bitcoin is down 28% from its recent highs and dropped 9% over the past year. The volatility makes people question how you can build stable high yield products on top of it. One former bond trader called Saylors moves folly and said hiking rates to maintain a peg wont work when people want their money back during a panic.\n\nStrategy already has a product called STRC that works somewhat like this - its grown to $2.9 billion but faces doubts about whether it can handle a real liquidity crunch.\n\nThe idea is innovative but feels like it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating long term to actually work. What happens during extended bear markets?",

With the missing October data, and the compromised November data, I actually think they might opt to hold rates steady until they have a more complete data set in January. From their point of view there is no harm in waiting; one month won't make a big difference in the long term. Looking at the most recent reports, the data doesnt seem to support the notion that inflation is coming down or that joblessness is much worse than it was earlier this year--look at the charts. I'm sure a lot of you want to tell me that the job market is trash, and I agree, but it's not in the data. And we definitely can't be certain that tariffs are gone for good. I'm preparing for a bloodbath this Wednesday, maybe even the beginning of the AI crash. ",

      "content": "The Bubble that Nobody is Talking About? Consumer Credit\n\n\n\r\nFinancial media has been clogged with headlines and hit pieces about the “AI bubble.” Everyone and their mother is running in circles drawing parallels between this bull run and the dot com bubble of the late 90s or the railway bubble at the turn of the twentieth century. Although I do not agree that we are in the late stages of a bubble right now, it is impossible to deny that massive bull runs are usually followed by a hangover that is often proportional to the loftiness of valuations during such runs. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is one alarming weakness that nobody is really paying attention to amongst the AI discourse: what seems to be a burgeoning consumer credit bubble. Buy now, pay later schemes have become a lifeline for consumers. \n\nNo longer are these services being used only to purchase luxuries beyond the means of the consumers that use them. Now, consumers are using them to fund life’s necessities like their grocery shopping. A LendingTree survey first conducted in April found that 25% of BNPL users are financing their groceries with BNPL schemes, the situation becomes even bleaker looking at the habits of younger users: 33% of Gen Z BNPL users have used the short term loans to buy groceries. An update to the survey, published in November, found that an increasing proportion of individuals view BNPL as a “bridge to their next paycheck.” \r\n\r\nWhat’s unclear is how exactly these very low quality consumer debts are being serviced – are there games being played with CDOs again like we saw in 2008? Even if the answer is no, it is hardly re-assuring that the number of people who see these loans as a means to fund their day-to-day lives is steadily increasing. This cannot go on forever. \r\n\r\nI’m curious to see what others thoughts are on this? Because of our myopic focus on the so-called AI bubble, are we missing something that is an even more immediate and perhaps greater structural threat? \n",

The decision partially rolls back restrictions that had previously barred shipments of Nvidia’s A100, H100, and H200-class GPUs to Chinese customers over national security concerns.\n\nUnder the revised rules, Nvidia may resume sales of the H200 so long as exported configurations fall within newly defined performance limits and comply with enhanced government monitoring. The adjustment follows weeks of uncertainty, during which Nvidia executives repeatedly emphasized that final export approval would ultimately come from President Trump.\n\nChina represents 20 to 25% of Nvidia’s data-center revenue. Restoring access even partially could meaningfully lift 2026 sales guidance.",

The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report.\n\nBeijing has been [pushing back](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cautions-tech-firms-over-nvidia-h20-ai-chip-purchases-sources-say-2025-08-12/) against domestic firms' use of U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions.\n\nEarlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development.\n\nThe export of the [H200 chips](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-open-up-exports-nvidia-h200-chips-china-semafor-reports-2025-12-08/) will be permitted with a 25% fee levied on such sales, Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to export other chip lines such as Blackwell or Rubin.\n\nShares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading.

      "content": "Diageo - at what point does this become a value investment\n\nDiageo's share price is at its cheapest in over ten years mostly owed to fears of the people drinking less, and tariffs. The stock price has fallen significantly more than earnings in recent years and now trades at a low multiple compared to historic standards. Still the company looks to recover next year with a new CEO, Sir Dave Lewis taking over at the start of January. The company also maintains some of the most recognizable alcohol brands in the world including: Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Baileys.\n\nI'm interested to hear what people think of this company as an investment.",

So I want to hear if anyone has any experience.\n\nI read some posts, and some people said that cold calling and emails are not good options anymore, since all the spam and AI ads. Some people have advised me that I should go in person. So I'm curious if anyone has any ideas how work works, and if any of you have had experience with companies and consumers?\n\nOne thing that i was advised on is also that I should make a poster and put it in stores with water equipment so that people who have these problems could experience our solution.\n\nIn short, I need some tips if anyone has any ideas or experience.",

      "content": "Some companies that I find interesting as of late\n\nHey, so if you don't know, I post more a lot in the daily threads over at r/stocks. I do like to write from time to time and have written a few posts in the past. One was around what I have learned along the years of investing, with like how I screen and how I research things.\n\nMy approach is kind of a blend of Lynch and Buffet, where I'm a GARPy style investor. I don't mind paying fair price for something, like Buffet would say \"**It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price\".** So when I screen, I like to look for companies with a PEG under 2 and have high ROIC with growing revenues.\n\nMore than happy to share my screener as well.\n\nI think a big part of becoming a successful investor is having to research. I actually enjoy doing this, since this can basically be a free hobby. You get to learn more about the world around you, plus just different industries.\n\nI also feel like this is one area you can do well, is finding some under the radar names that have little no analyst coverage.\n\nBelow are some stocks I just find interesting, Doesn't mean you should go out and buy these names, but rather just highlighting some companies you probably have never heard of and just to bring up for the sake of discussion.\n\nSo here are those companies:\n\n**BK Technologies Corp**\n\n[https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/bkti/statistics/](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/bkti/statistics/)\n\nSmaller company, but fundamentals are pretty solid. I have a thing for small float companies with good or high insider ownership. This company fits that, with only 2.97M shares available on the float with 13% insider ownership. Also has like no debt.\n\nReally strong numbers the last 4 quarters with revenue growth not being that great, but with gross margins and operating margins really improving as well as ROIC is looking really strong.\n\n[https://quickfs.net/company/BKTI:US](https://quickfs.net/company/BKTI:US)\n\nBasically the company makes two way land mobile radios. They basically sell to all the federal agencies and have strong connections with them. Part of the story is the company outsourcing manufacturing which has led them to have less inventory, better margins and improved their working capital.\n\nLatest investor presentation:\n\n[https://storage.googleapis.com/vendorgroup-assets/site/7ada4fe6-a4f7-4e86-9996-2496b9a16c77/2025/11/14/6917b28bb189d74a2140312e/BK%20Investor%20Presentation%20November%202025%20FINAL.pdf](https://storage.googleapis.com/vendorgroup-assets/site/7ada4fe6-a4f7-4e86-9996-2496b9a16c77/2025/11/14/6917b28bb189d74a2140312e/BK%20Investor%20Presentation%20November%202025%20FINAL.pdf)\n\n**Synchrony Financial**\n\n[https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/syf/statistics/](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/syf/statistics/)\n\nMuch larger market cap here, with this one being 28B. Overall, it's a pretty cheap valuation for the company with the forward and trailing PE both at 8, with a PEG at 0.56. This company basically does financing and branded credit cards for retailers, making them more of a niche play.\n\nThis one is a basically really boring compounder that has the risks of all credit names, but just offers a really cheap valuation.\n\nLatest quarter presentation:\n\n[https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_c50e3de2621b1ea575f46ab042c83ac6/synchrony/db/3606/33918/presentation/3Q%2725+Earnings+Presentation\\_vFINAL.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_c50e3de2621b1ea575f46ab042c83ac6/synchrony/db/3606/33918/presentation/3Q%2725+Earnings+Presentation_vFINAL.pdf)\n\n**Brainsway Ltd - ADR**\n\nThis one is way more speculative of a name and not cheap, but the PEG is still about 1.04, since the EPS growth has been great.\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BWAY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BWAY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)\n\nROIC is a bit lower, but the company is what new to being profitable, but still seeing double digits revenue growth since Sep 2023. It has been a bit more normalized the past four quarters, around 27% growth QoQ.\n\nAnother name is little debt, around 6.75M, but has 70M in cash &amp; cash equivalents.\n\nOverall, I just find this company really interesting, what they do almost sounds fake. It offers Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation platform technology for the treatment of major depressive disorders, anxious depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, smoking addiction, bipolar disorders, post traumatic stress disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, post stroke rehabilitation, and Parkinson’s diseases.\n\nThis is all FDA approved as well.\n\nTheir latest investor presentation:\n\n[https://investors.brainsway.com/static-files/2902f3d8-e9b7-4fb1-9114-4e0c60d993a3](https://investors.brainsway.com/static-files/2902f3d8-e9b7-4fb1-9114-4e0c60d993a3)\n\n**Flotek Industries Inc**\n\nJust opened a position in them this morning. They've been on my screener for a bit, but never looked into them. I tend to stay away from oil &amp; gas names, really just own like one name in the space, FTI (which is another fun company)\n\nValuation isn't too bad by any means:\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FTK](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FTK)\n\nWhat is wild about this company, is the explosive growth they are seeing because they are basically going all into their data analytics side of things.\n\nKind's of wild how much this has changed up the companies growth. Gross margins went from like 18.3% in Sep 2024 to 31.7% Sept 2025. Same thing happened with operating margins, going from 5.5% to 16.5% that same time period. ROIC is also looking great and the EPS growth is really impressive.\n\n[https://quickfs.net/company/FTK:US](https://quickfs.net/company/FTK:US)",

Although it’s the default “VOO and chill” which is a little boring, it’s relatively reliable and stable as a compounder and captures the overall strength of the US economy.\n\n- QQQM as the turbocharger for growth. Yes, VOO already has tech, but I see QQQM as a deliberate overweight into the sector which beats the broad market over the long run. I’m still on the boat that the tech sector will continue to thrive exponentially.\n\n- VXUS to capture everything non-US related. Europe, Japan, emerging markets, developed Asia. When the dollar weakens, when US valuations get too hot, when global cycles differ, VXUS is my ballast and the global hedge so I can ensure that I’m not betting my entire future on just one country.",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-09 10:32:10 | **Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT  \n**Bullish with Elevated Retail Speculation & Policy-Driven Volatility**  \n\n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Retail traders are highly engaged, with discussions dominated by **Nvidia/AI chip policy** (multiple high-scoring posts), **meme-stock activity** (GME, CVNA), and **earnings anticipation** (\"Happy Earnings Day\"). The tone is speculative, with posts highlighting \"suspicious activity\" and large market orders, indicating heightened retail sensitivity to volatility and momentum plays.  \n- **Macro Backdrop:** The equity risk premium (4.33%) remains supportive for equities, but the VIX at 16.66 suggests moderate near-term volatility expectations. The disconnect between economic concerns (\"Economy is dragging\") and market performance is a focal point, reflecting a \"bad news is good news\" dynamic or anticipation of policy support.  \n- **Policy Catalyst:** Trump's comments on Nvidia chip sales to China are a clear sentiment driver, likely viewed as positive for tech/AI sectors despite geopolitical tensions.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES  \n**A. Geopolitical Tech Policy & AI Supply Chain**  \n- Reddit: Multiple posts on Nvidia H200 sales to China (Trump's announcement, export ban schemes).  \n- Implication: Potential easing of chip restrictions could benefit semiconductor/AI stocks, but regulatory risks persist.  \n\n**B. Retail-Driven Momentum & Meme Stock Activity**  \n- Reddit: GME (Tudor Investment 88M shares), CVNA fraud allegations, \"apes\" earnings day references.  \n- Implication: Renewed meme-stock interest signals speculative froth; could lead to sharp, sentiment-driven moves.  \n\n**C. Macroeconomic Divergence**  \n- Reddit: \"Economy is dragging, but stock market thriving.\"  \n- RSS News: USDA lowers cattle outlook, Howard Marks warns on AI job impact, Colombian/French fiscal concerns.  \n- Data: Unemployment at 4.4%, Fed funds at 3.89%—suggests growth concerns but no immediate recession fear.  \n\n**D. Earnings & Event-Driven Volatility**  \n- Reddit: Earnings day mentions, PPI report delay (could defer inflation worries).  \n- RSS: Warner Bros./Netflix synergy speculation, Tanger retail rebound, Carlyle fundraising optimism.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Catalysts:**  \n- **Nvidia (NVDA) Policy News:** Trump's China sales approval could lift semiconductor sector; watch for official confirmation and Chinese response.  \n- **Earnings Season:** Retail focus on \"earnings day\" suggests high sensitivity to surprises (especially in meme stocks).  \n- **PPI Delay:** October report postponed to mid-January may temporarily reduce inflation anxiety, supporting equities.  \n\n**Technical Signals:**  \n- NVDA showing minor decline (-0.38%) in snapshot; could see rebound on policy news.  \n- VIX at 16.66 indicates complacency but not extreme; monitor for spikes on geopolitical or earnings shocks.  \n- Gold (GLD) at 386.865 suggests moderate haven demand amid policy uncertainty.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Risks:**  \n1. **Geopolitical Overhang:** Chip sales policy could reverse or face backlash; China-U.S. tensions remain latent risk.  \n2. **Retail Speculation Excess:** Meme-stock activity (GME, CVNA) and options chatter (NFLX 40k OTM) signal froth; risk of sharp corrections if momentum breaks.  \n3. **Macro Divergence:** Stock market outperformance despite economic \"dragging\" may be unsustainable if earnings weaken.  \n4. **Inflation Data Gaps:** PPI delay creates uncertainty; CPI remains elevated (324.368).  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Semiconductor/AI Policy Relief:** Potential upside in NVDA and chip suppliers if China sales expand.  \n2. **Retail & Real Estate Recovery:** Tanger CEO's retail rebound comments, Ares real estate outlook suggest selective value.  \n3. **Green Energy Investment:** BlackRock's move into Birla’s green energy company aligns with sustained ESG capital flows.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**SYMBOL: NVDA** – Monitor for breakout above $185 on confirmed China sales news; policy catalyst could drive short-term rally, but watch for profit-taking given recent volatility.  \n**SYMBOL: GME** – High retail interest per Tudor Investment position; expect elevated volatility around earnings/news flow; risk-reward skewed for traders, not investors.  \n**SYMBOL: CVNA** – Fraud allegations trending on Reddit; avoid until clarity emerges, but high short interest could fuel squeeze if sentiment shifts.  \n**SECTOR: Semiconductors** – Policy-driven opportunity (NVDA, AMD, SMH); pair with geopolitical risk hedge (e.g., defense stocks).  \n**SECTOR: Retail Real Estate** – Tanger (SKT) and Ares (ARES) signals suggest selective recovery plays; focus on outlets with strong balance sheets.  \n**MACRO: Watch VIX & Treasury Yields** – VIX spike above 18 would signal rising fear; 10Y yield above 4.2% could pressure growth stocks.  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** The market is bullish but driven by retail speculation and policy headlines. Focus on semiconductor opportunities from China sales news, but remain wary of meme-stock volatility and geopolitical shifts. Use dips in AI/green energy for accumulation, and maintain hedges given elevated sentiment extremes.  \n\n**Next Update:** Monitor RSS for official policy confirmations and Reddit for retail flow shifts.",

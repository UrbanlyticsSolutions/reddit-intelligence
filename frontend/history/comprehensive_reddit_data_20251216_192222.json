      "content": "U.S. crude oil drops below $55 a barrel, hits lowest level since early 2021\n\nOil has been under steady pressure this year, and it doesn’t seem to be coming from just one factor. OPEC+ has been adding supply back into the market faster than many expected after years of disciplined output cuts, and that extra production is starting to show up in inventories and price action. At the same time, the geopolitical risk premium that supported crude over the past couple of years is slowly deflating. Markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, or at least a less volatile outlook, which reduces fears around supply disruptions tied to the conflict.\nPut together, it’s a tough setup for oil bulls: more barrels coming online while the “fear bid” fades. Demand hasn’t collapsed, but it hasn’t been strong enough to absorb the new supply without pressure on prices. Curious how others are thinking about this is this just a cyclical oversupply phase, or does it mark a longer period of capped oil prices if geopolitics cool and OPEC+ prioritizes volume over price?\n\n Source :\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/crude-oil-prices-today.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "content": "Why Dr. Burry can’t talk about swaps, FTDs, or “the plumbing”  and why that silence actually matters\n\n1. What Burry didn’t say (and why people noticed) A lot of people reacted to Burry’s post by saying:\n\nHe didn’t mention swaps\n\nHe didn’t mention FTDs\n\nHe didn’t talk about the buy button\n\nHe didn’t reference the $80+ run with RK’s disclosed position\n\nHe didn’t disclose his current position\n\nAt face value, that looks STRANGE, especially if you’ve been following GME CLOSELY. But this assumes Burry is just another Twitter commentator.\n\nHe’s not.\n\n2. There’s a hard legal line between “opinion” and “allegation”\n\nTalking about:\n\nvaluation\n\nbalance sheets\n\ncapital allocation\n\npatience\n\nincentives\n\n\\-&gt; legal, protected financial opinion\n\nTalking about:\n\npersistent FTDs implying non-delivery\n\nswaps being used to hide short exposure\n\nprice suppression through settlement mechanics\n\nbrokers/clearing houses failing to deliver shares\n\n\\-&gt;implicit allegations of market manipulation or settlement failure\n\nThat’s not commentary. That’s accusation.\n\nOnce a hedge fund manager publicly connects:\n\nspecific stock + settlement failures + identifiable MECHANISMS they expose themselves to:\n\nSEC inquiries\n\nsubpoenas\n\ndiscovery\n\naccusations of market signaling or manipulation\n\nBurry already lived through this once after 2008. He knows exactly where that line is.\n\n3. Why FTDs are especially radioactive\n\nReported short interest:\n\nis self-reported\n\nnetted\n\ndelayed\n\nlegally sanitized\n\nFTDs are different:\n\nthey are hard settlement failures\n\nthey show up after the trade\n\nthey imply that someone sold something they didn’t deliver on time\n\nPublicly tying persistent FTDs to price behavior is essentially saying: “Someone cannot or will not deliver shares they sold.”\n\nThat’s not something a regulated fund manager can casually TWEET. Retail can talk about it. Analysts can speculate. Dr. Burry cannot.\n\n4. Why he talks about time instead of price\n\nIf Burry believed, “this resolves via a quick squeeze”  he’d say nothing.\n\nIf Burry believed, “this is immediate fraud” he’d stay silent.\n\nInstead, he emphasized:\n\npatience\n\noptionality\n\ncapital discipline\n\nbalance sheet strength\n\nThat framing only makes sense if:\n\npressure exists\n\nit is being actively managed\n\nresolution depends on time, not a single event\n\nFTDs, swaps, and synthetic exposure are time-based problems. They don’t explode instantly, they compound.\n\nThat’s the subtext.\n\n5. Why GameStop’s cash position matters more than people think (not apes 😁)\n\nHolding cash is often mocked as “doing nothing.”\n\nIn reality:\n\ncash removes bankruptcy risk\n\ncash denies shorts their best exit\n\ncash preserves optionality\n\nIf you believe there is structural short exposure, then: Not deploying capital prematurely is rational.\n\nWhy pull the trigger on the only hostage you have left?\n\nBurry highlighting patience isn’t passive, it’s strategic.\n\n6. Silence ≠ ignorance\n\nThe idea that Dr. Michael Burry an seasoned investor capable of getting large investment banks to write him custom TRS contracts​, understands swaps, understands FTDs, understands incentives …but somehow “forgot” to mention them publicly …is far less believable than the idea that he can’t mention them.\n\nHis post isn’t for retail hype, It’s for people who already understand how this works.\n\n7. The tell: what everyone avoids saying out loud\n\nNotice who else never speaks directly about:\n\nnaked shorts\n\nswaps\n\nFTDs\n\nRyan Cohen. Roaring Kitty. Michael Burry.\n\nDifferent people. Same silence.\n\nThat’s not coincidence. That’s legal reality.\n\nConclusion\n\nBurry’s post wasn’t incomplete, it was bounded. He said what he legally could:\n\npatience\n\ncapital structure\n\ntime\n\nEverything else swaps, FTDs, settlement stress is left for readers to infer. In markets like this, what isn’t said matters more than what is. And silence, in this case, isn’t weakness.\n\nIt’s self-preservation.\n\nTL;DR Michael Burry didn’t “miss” swaps, FTDs, or market structure issues in his recent comments on GameStop. He can’t talk about them without inviting a legal and regulatory nightmare. What he did say about patience, capital structure, and time is the maximum signal he can legally send.\n\nLooking forward to part2 💎👐\n\nNote this is not a Burry fluff piece I'm just sharing my humble thoughts on what I think this implies. I love the fact that the big short OG is talking about my Favorite company after all these years. The saga continues.\n\n  \nThanks to... banana-in-my-anus for the contribution 😀",

Assuming Tesla car sales will also be impacted *(+ remaining headwind from the political turnoil earlier this year + Chinese EV competition in China and Europe)*, Tesla may go from unreasonable P/E to negative earnings. While last quarter was somewhat salvaged by the last minute demand to get in on the US EV credit, this won't be happening in Q4.\n\nWhile this doesn't necessarily change the long term picture *(whether you buy AV + robots thesis or not)*, I do think this will spook investors quite a bit and force a reality check.",

      "content": "Tesla stock hits record as Wall Street rallies around robotaxi hype despite slow EV sales\n\nTesla’s stock just set a new record, breaking past its previous all-time high from almost exactly a year ago. The rally comes after a wild 12 months for shareholders including a brutal 36% drop in Q1, the stock’s worst quarterly performance since 2022. What’s driving the rebound now seems to be renewed optimism around Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi vision. Investors appear to be betting that Tesla can finally convert its existing fleet of EVs into autonomous, revenue-generating vehicles, rather than treating autonomy as a distant concept. Still, it’s hard to ignore how quickly sentiment has flipped. From heavy losses early in the year to record highs now, Tesla remains one of the most emotion-driven names in the market.\nDo you see this move as confidence in real progress on autonomy, or just another sentiment-driven Tesla cycle?\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/tesla-stock-hits-record-on-robotaxi-hype-despite-drop-in-ev-sales.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "content": "TSLA's epic surge: With its core business collapsing, why did its stock price reach a new all-time high of $491.5?\n\nTSLA surged against the market trend today, reaching a new all-time high of $491.5, while Elon Musk's net worth soared to over $670 billion.  This stands in stark contrast to the company's core business struggles, including a nearly 40% drop in European sales and institutional forecasts of declining Q4 deliveries. The truth is: Wall Street has completely abandoned fundamental analysis of TSLA's automotive business. They are making a massive gamble that Musk will successfully transform into the core of an AI empire $1.6 trillion market capitalization is just the beginning. What they truly value is the $1 trillion profit potential of the FSD software, the multi-trillion-dollar market for CyberCab and Optimus robots by 2026, and the epic narrative of the SpaceX space economy behind it all. This high-risk gamble, which completely ties personal wealth, grand narratives, and extreme valuations together, means that TSLA is a bet that will either reach $3 trillion or see its dreams shattered.\n\nAt this point, would you buy at a high price, or would you wait and see?",

      "content": "Nasdaq moves to make trading nearly 24 hours. Why some on Wall Street say that’s a bad idea\n\nNasdaq says it plans to file with the SEC to allow U.S. stocks and ETFs to trade almost around the clock, five days a week, starting as early as the second half of 2026. The proposal would stretch trading to 23 hours per weekday, splitting the market into a long “day session” (4 a.m.–8 p.m. ET), a one-hour pause, and an overnight session (9 p.m.–4 a.m.). Supporters argue this just formalizes what already exists in crypto and futures, and better serves global investors who don’t operate on U.S. time zones. Critics aren’t convinced. Concerns center on thinner liquidity during overnight hours, bigger price swings, and whether constant trading would amplify short-term speculation rather than improve price discovery.\nCurious how others see this. Is nearly nonstop equity trading the natural next step, or does it risk creating more volatility without real benefits for long-term investors?\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/nasdaq-moves-to-near-24-hour-trading-some-say-thats-a-bad-idea.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

At this point, it’s the only player running large-scale, fully driverless commercial services in multiple cities, which gives it a meaningful real-world data advantage. Amazon’s Zoox is taking a different approach, starting with limited public access. It’s begun offering free driverless rides around parts of the Las Vegas Strip and select San Francisco neighborhoods, signaling confidence in its tech but still moving cautiously. Tesla has entered the conversation with a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the Bay Area, but as of mid-December those vehicles still rely on human drivers or safety supervisors. That puts Tesla more in a pilot phase than true autonomy for now.\nOverall, the gap between “driverless demos” and fully autonomous, scaled operations is becoming clearer. Waymo looks firmly in front today, while Zoox and Tesla are progressing just on very different timelines and risk profiles.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/waymo-amazon-zoox-tesla-robotaxi-expansion.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

The board is expected to recommend shareholders vote against the bid.\n\nThe renewed acceptance of Netflix's acquisition offer marks the latest development in this bidding war. The target of this contest includes Warner Bros.' storied film and television studio, along with its vast library of movies and TV shows a portfolio spanning classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to contemporary hits such as Harry Potter and Friends, as well as the HBO and HBO Max streaming services.\n\nA Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe winner will gain a significant advantage in the streaming wars by securing a vast content library that has long been a target for acquisition.\n\nEarlier this month, Netflix ultimately prevailed in its $27 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Warner Bros.' non-cable assets.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison subsequently made a direct, all-cash $30-per-share takeover bid to Warner Bros. shareholders.\n\nParamount stated in filings submitted to regulators that its acquisition proposal is superior to Netflix's bid and more likely to secure regulatory approval. Paramount's acquisition plan consists of $41 billion in new equity backed by the Ellison family and Redbird Capital, along with $54 billion in debt financing commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo Global Management.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Affinity Partners, a firm owned by Jared Kushner and one of Paramount Pictures' financing partners, will withdraw from the competition.\n\nParamount Pictures and Affinity Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.",

Assuming technology is the driver of further economic growth it seems a refocus on industry and physical assets is inevitable.  \n\n  \nMy argument is that exponential advancement in software capabilities shifts value into physical assets.  Without laying out a dissertation, essentially money goes somewhere to pay people, and highly skilled labor will remain untouched by AI until robotics themselves become economically viable to replace skilled labor.\n\nEnter industry.  Whether it's factory automation, infrastructure to support, tooling and maintenance, or the manufacturing of actual assets themselves that are produced, skilled labor is required across all of it.  Execution that bridges into the physical world cannot be performed directly by software systems.  Companies need to fund that labor, and the companies that control the labor become valuable.\n\n  \nUnless UBI somehow becomes a thing, I don't really see another avenue toward economic viability in G20 economies 3-5+ years out.\n\nI post here because industrial companies outside of a few name brands like GE and CAT are generally quite cheap on the market.\n\nAnyone care to share opinions or thoughts?

Discovery is preparing to advise its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance’s hostile takeover bid, with a formal recommendation expected as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount’s proposal valued Warner Bros. Discovery at roughly $108 billion in an all-cash offer, or about $30 per share, but board members have expressed concerns over the offer’s financing, structure and overall terms compared with other strategic options. The board appears inclined to recommend the company’s existing deal with Netflix which combines cash and stock and focuses on core studio and streaming assets as a more secure and valuable path forward for shareholders.\n\nThe market has reacted to the escalating deal drama, with Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock weakening as news of the planned rejection circulated. Investors are watching closely as Paramount’s bid backed in part by funding from equity and debt partners faces internal resistance, and as other players like Netflix remain in contention. \n\nAlso, Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners has reportedly exited the takeover battle, marking a shift in financing participation for the Paramount bid. Paramount still has time to revise or sweeten its offer before its tender deadline in early January, but Warner Bros. Discovery’s board seems poised to side with the alternative that they believe offers greater certainty and value for shareholders",

Basics/Getting Started)\n\nThis famed short-seller explains why he’s doubling down on his bet against data centers\n\nJim Chanos says the money will come from what the chips produce, not where they reside\n\nBy Barbara Kollmeyer\n\nInvestors continue to push doubts to the surface over AI bets paying off into year-end.\n\n \nAmong those with strong views on that theme is prominent investment manager Jim Chanos, best known for past short selling bets on Enron and Tesla. In a podcast interview with Monetary Matters with Jack Farley, Chanos discussed why he thinks dot-com bust 2.0 could be coming as he explained one bearish bet he’s doubling down on.\n \n\nThe investor placed a big short bet on legacy data centers in 2022, describing the old cloud data center business as “crummy,” with a “very low return on capital business, highly capital intensive.”\n \n\nChanos said he’s even less convinced on the newest version of data centers — those that host GPUs, or rent out computing power to AI companies. “It’s basically a commodity business, particularly as everybody’s building them. And our view to clients has been the magic and the money is going to come from what the chips produce ultimately, not where they reside,” he said.\n\n \nInvestors wanting to make AI bets should stick to pure AI titans like OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, or hyperscalers, he said. “But investing in bitcoin miners that are converting to data center companies or me-too companies that are jumping on the so-called neoclouds, which are basically just landlords, to me seems problematic for two reasons,” he said.\n\n\n**Chanos mentioned CoreWeave CRWV by name while bitcoin miners-turned-data-center companies include Iren IREN and Cipher Mining CIFR.**\n \n\nThe first is that hosting GPUs is a low -margin, low-return on capital business, and the second is any data center buying the GPUs themselves must be making a bet on depreciation, he said. Chanos’ own estimate is that those GPUs could end up obsolete or not fast enough for clients within five years. Hedge fund founder Harris Kupperman and “Big Short” investor Michael Burry have also delivered strong warnings on GPU depreciation.\n \n\n**Chanos said that among the big hyperscalers building out their data centers — such as Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Oracle ORCL and Amazon AMZN — the first two will be able to finance that from their cash flows, but the rest “will need external financing.”**\n \n\nThe overriding AI bet is the technology will hit an inflection point in 2027 or 2028 and profits will flow. Oracle and Amazon have shown an inability thus far to monetize those big investments in AI, equipment, hardware and locations, and that’s one reason he’s short on Oracle.\n \n\n \n\nHe added that many big hyperscalers want to get the data-center business off their own balance sheets and just lease from someone else. “The bet is you’re buying these things and leasing them out and that five or six years is actually too conservative, you’ll be able to earn money on them for 10 or 12 years,” he said.\n \n\nChanos said the data-center world is going to shrink as just a handful will be needed and makes the scenario look “a lot like 1999 and 2000.”\n \n\nHe warns that a credit crunch or pullback in sentiment such as seen the early 2000s would see a lot of that spending by those companies drop fairly fast. “The risk levels for all these companies are much higher than they were five or 10 years ago,” he said.\n\nFIN\n\n\nThe pod cast article is here\n\nhttps://trkmw.dowjones.com/click/43066481.216328/aHR0cHM6Ly9wb2RjYXN0cy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvcG9kY2FzdC90aGUtYWktZGF0YS1jZW50ZXItc2hvcnQtamltLWNoYW5vcy1vbi1vcmFjbGUtZGF0YS9pZDE3NjkwOTM5MDY_aT0xMDAwNzQxMzk3NTc0Jm1vZD1kamVtX213bm5lZWR0b2tub3c/6776e8dd2719be24a983dc02Bc8498078\n\n\n———\n\n*My comment:*\n\nCharlie Munger said that the biggest mistake a person can make is not learning from others and only want to learn from their own mistakes, because this time it is different.\n\nMichael Burry and Jim Chanos might be early but they are not usually wrong. Mock them at your own peril. \n\n",

The target of this contest includes Warner Bros.' storied film and television studio, along with its vast library of movies and TV shows a portfolio spanning classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to contemporary hits such as Harry Potter and Friends, as well as the HBO and HBO Max streaming services.\n\nA Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe winner will gain a significant advantage in the streaming wars by securing a vast content library that has long been a target for acquisition.\n\nEarlier this month, Netflix ultimately prevailed in its $27 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Warner Bros.' non-cable assets.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison subsequently made a direct, all-cash $30-per-share takeover bid to Warner Bros. shareholders.\n\nParamount stated in filings submitted to regulators that its acquisition proposal is superior to Netflix's bid and more likely to secure regulatory approval. Paramount's acquisition plan consists of $41 billion in new equity backed by the Ellison family and Redbird Capital, along with $54 billion in debt financing commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo Global Management.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Affinity Partners, a firm owned by Jared Kushner and one of Paramount Pictures' financing partners, will withdraw from the competition.\n\nParamount Pictures and Affinity Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.",

The last 10 years have been close, but BRK still pulled ahead.  \n\nWith Buffett stepping down and BRK being a very mature company now, can it still outperform $VOO over the next 10 years?  My thought is that active investing may actually start to outperform again.  Over 50% of fund flows are now into passive/indexing and there is risk of a bubble forming there.  This means when those passive funds nosedive hard, active investors with the cash can swoop in and buy their exaggerated lows.  Also, with the S&amp;P 500 extremely valued on so many metrics:  CAPE/Shiller P/E, Buffet Indicator (market cap-to-GDP), and regular P/E, I think return prospects won’t be very good over the next 10 years in U.S. stocks.  \n\nI like emerging markets, precious metals, and individual stocks more.  \n\nBut I think active investing may finally make a comeback too and beat passive with this setup.  If you HAD TO ONLY CHOOSE ONE, which would you rather hold:  BRK or VOO over the next 10 years.  You cannot sell the holding, nor invest in the other until 2035.  😋",

      "content": "Tesla is more like Bitcoin than an actual stock\n\nHere's my thesis: **the price of Tesla stock is more important than its earnings**\n\nBias here: Huge Tesla Bear. I hate Elon both politically and as a human, I think Tesla makes good cars.\n\nMy list of winners I've picked correctly where I've made at least 50% in the last 24 months include (shorts with a (-) sign): PWRMF, ACMR, GOOGL, LAC, SIVR, SPOT, RTX -BUMBL.\n\nMy list of losers that are down at least 20% in the last 24 months: PYPL, GETY, UBER, -PTON, -TSLA, -DJT.\n\nTo understand Tesla stock we need to understand asset classes as a whole. Think residential real estate and MBS. Think Bitcoin. Think gold. In stocks we claim this measure to be ETFs like VOO or SPY.\n\nSo, here's the problem: the dollar is losing value. You can measure this against other currencies, or bitcoin or any metric. We are printing money and growing out debt and inflation is happening and will continue to happen.\n\nSo rich people need to hedge against this. Gold is up 114% and silver 116% in the last years. At the same time, Bitcoin is up 104%. Real estate fairly flat (after double digit gains in 2021 and 2022) but still. up around 6-8% over the same time period. SPY is up 46.4% over the same time period.\n\nSo when all assets are up, and inflation is up, its not just performance driving the price.\n\nAmong these asset classes, the stock market the best combination of liquid, tax-favorable, legal and safe. No one puts their 401k in gold, bitcoin is quasi legal still and real estate is very illiquid. What Obama learned and then Biden and Trump is that stonks needs to always go up. In our K shaped economy, it's no longer unemployment or inflation as the Fed's dual mandate claims, but keep the stock market smooth and you will get credit for keeping things smooth. Through bank bailouts, auto bail outs, mortgage meltdowns, Covid, tariffs, war, WHO GIVES AF. The wealthiest 10% own 50% of the stock market and they need to keep their wealth compounding to keep their donations flowing. \\*\\*We will print money, we will take part ownership in companies, we will buy bad loans, we literally do fking anything other than let the stock market go down.\\*\\*\n\nNow here's the question: What IS the stock market? Typically the largest and wealthiest funds take giant stakes in Blue chip companies and broad based ETS. But what do you do when automation/stagflation is muting dividends and small returns of mature industrials and the Mag7 hot tech stocks represent 35% of the entire S&amp;P.\n\nIf you're say a president who's obsessed with the stock market, and is known for transactional dealings and favorable deals to friends, and you want to keep the stock market afloat, what is easier - to keep buoying a small number of really big stocks or try and do an FDR style new deal to drive the engine of commerce and lift all boats with a rising tide? It's waaaay easier to just say \"Hey Jensen, hey Elon, lets make these deals\".\n\nIf you're a crony with money, whose entire wealth and livelihood depends on your assets under management increasing, same question. Now if you two team up together? Institutional fund diamond hands means government contracts and favorable tax deals.\n\n**It's all a long way of saying Tesla (and Mag7 broadly) have become too big too fail**. If we bailed out fucking Ford and GM because of auto jobs in detroit you can bet your ass we will bail out every Americans 401k, all of which rely on Mag7. The only reason the other companies in Mag7 haven't been exposed is that they actually increase profit and are worth the money. If tesla traded even at 2x the forward 12 month PE of its peers we'd see it lose 60% in market cap which would trigger a broad meltdown of the entire stock market and probably trigger a panic sell off.\n\n**\\*\\*So TL;DR -\\***\\* rich people need stocks to go up to keep their money safe from inflation. Telsa and Mag7 are needed to go up for this to happen, so the oligarchs and our government simply won't let them fail. Tesla is a store of value like bitcoin more than a stock that operates on fundamentals like P/E and earnings growth",

Few months ago it traded a similar or even lesser mcap to Amazon. The run up on Google was justified due to the company rapidly building and scaling its AI products. The important question to ask is the scope of higher return from here on especially since so much is priced into the stock.\n\nAmazon on the other hand has been viewed as a company with lesser growth outlook due to tariff and rising competition to its AWS business. I look at it differently. They are spending aggressively on AI infrastructure, if they build lot of capacity, they have a way to monetize it in one way or another since they have a more diversified stream of businesses. They also have scope of expanding their retail margins all of which can contribute to growing its earning power significantly.\n\nLong Amazon!",

      "title": "Meta: Metaverse Cuts Are Not The Story. How It Affects AI Spend Is",
      "content": "Meta: Metaverse Cuts Are Not The Story. How It Affects AI Spend Is\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe reported cuts to the Reality Labs’ budget have likely been overstated. First, it is unclear how big the cuts are and which part of Reality Labs they affect. Will it just be VR and the Metaverse, or will augmented reality (smart glasses) be included? Reports are of 10% and 30% cuts. Again, how will this be spread out?\n\nIf we assume it is 30% of the entirety of Reality Labs, which I don’t believe. With expenses of \\~$16 billion, that would be over $4 billion in cuts. But remember, Meta is expected to have expenses in the range of $116-$118 billion in 2025, which will accelerate in 2026. $4 billion is not all that significant compared to the massive spend on AI.\n\nThis metaverse cut is not that big of a deal. What is important is what it tells us about the AI spend and Metas’ willingness to cut it back if needed. Therefore, I see two likely outcomes for Meta. One, Mark Zuckerberg will reduce spend in the face of weak demand for AI, or two, AI will be a success and the high spend will continue.\n\nDoing a discounted cash flow valuation on both cases, I find Meta to be good value in either scenario. I get a weighted valuation of $950.\n\nImage: Reality Labs Revenue And Expenses\n\nI wasn't able to add images, you can search the same title for my Substack post to see them. Oh, I had to take out the reference links as Reddit was auto-blocking the post, I think.\n\n# Zuckerberg's Willingness To Change\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s willingness to change should not have come as a massive surprise. There are multiple examples throughout Zuckerberg's career where he has shown this flexibility.\n\nIn 2008, he embraced advertising, something he had long had doubts about, brought in Cheryl Sandberg, and gave up a lot of operational control when it was felt they needed an ‘Adult in the room’.\n\nAround 2010, Zuckerberg was all in on Facebook being a web-based platform without the need for a dedicated app. When that was proven wrong, they pivoted. Before long, they had one of the most popular apps in the world.\n\nAnd of course, more recently, they went all in on the metaverse, even changing the name of the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021. Then, in the 2022 Q4 report, they announced the ‘year of efficiency’. I see last week's reports of cuts in the metaverse as a continuation of this change of direction.\n\nIt is this history that gives me, and I believe some of the market, faith that Zuckerberg can change direction if it becomes clear that the massive AI spend is not generating the desired returns.\n\n# Two Scenarios\n\nTo help me value the company, I found it useful to think of two scenarios and do separate valuations for each of them. Scenario 1, AI returns do not appear, and cuts in CapEx are needed. Scenario 2, AI leads to increased revenue.\n\n**Scenario 1: Cuts to AI spend**\n\nMeta has been quite clear that AI has given tangible benefits to their underlying business. Most analysts expect over 15% growth in the next 12 months. In this scenario, I'm going to assume it ends there. Algorithms are as optimised as they can get, there are no more efficiencies to find, and no new AI revenue sources appear.\n\nImage: DCF Model For Scenario 1: Reduced CapEx\n\nI am modelling revenue falling back to a still respectable 8%, which will then trail off to a terminal growth rate of 5%. This may seem high given a failed AI pivot, but keep in mind the underlying business is still dominant in the world of social media. Ad spend is still migrating to online, the world, especially outside the US, is getting richer, and there is no reason to think that Meta will not continue to grow for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs we discussed in his history, I believe Zuckerberg will pivot in the face of an AI failure and reduce Capex and spend. Barring any writedown, this will likely take a number of years as depreciation works its way through the books. I am modelling EBIT margin to rise from the current \\~40% to a terminal margin of 49%. And for the terminal reinvestment, I'm assuming a return on invested capital of 20%.\n\nImage: Final DCF Calculations\n\nPutting all these numbers together. I get a valuation of $861. So even in the scenario of a failed AI buildout, there is a case for Meta to be good value. With that said, it is easy to see the stock selling off in that situation, which could allow for an even more attractive entry.\n\n# Scenario 2: AI is moderately successful\n\nAI succeeding is such a general statement that it is very difficult to model. I will assume their revenues remain higher for longer as they continue to reap the rewards of AI, both in their core business and in any new business models that come from AI. I am modelling them to have 20% growth, trailing off to 15% in 4 years, and then trailing off to a terminal growth rate of 5.5%.\n\nImage: DCF Model For Scenario 2: AI Moderate Success\n\nTo support this growth, I am continuing the high CapEx spend, but with that said, I am assuming that the costs are front-loaded and relative to revenue, CapEx will actually fail. I am modelling this as EBIT margins remaining fairly steady, with a terminal rate of 37%. For the terminal reinvestment, I am assuming a return on invested capital of 15%.\n\nImage: Final DCF Calculations\n\nAdding all that up gets me to a valuation of $1,115. Of course, there is plenty of room in this 'AI moderate success' scenario for more upside. I see this as a conservative valuation.\n\n# Combining The Models\n\nWhen I do more than one valuation model, I like to get a weighted average between them, which means we have to give each scenario a likelihood.\n\nWhile I believe AI will be transformational, I'm not convinced Meta will be the one to build it. For that reason, I'm putting ‘reduced CapEx’ as the slightly more likely scenario and giving it a 65% weighting.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, if a company wants to be successful, it will need piles of money, abundant sources of data, and a willingness to go for it. Zuckerberg and Meta have all of that. I am putting a weighting of 35% on the ‘AI moderately successful’ scenario.\n\nImage: Weighted Average Calculation\n\nAI will succeed or fail. It is black or white, but I do like to work in the grey middle, so for my overall valuation, I will be using this weighted average of $950. \n\nGiven the different potential outcomes, it will be important to regularly update this model and my $950 valuation. For now, I am confident in placing a BUY target on the stock.\n\n# Risks\n\nZuckerberg has full control over Meta with his super-voting rights. And while in the past he's shown a willingness to change direction. A shareholder still has to accept that they are at the whims of one person. If he digs his heels in and says he will succeed in AI or take Meta down with him, there is not much we can do\n\nAs with any international company, there will be regulation and antitrust risk. From European Union fines to the Austrailian under 16 ban, there is a constant risk on this front.\n\nIf AI is as disruptive as many think it will be, there is no valuation model, no company, and perhaps no industry that is safe.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMeta giving up on the metaverse is not the real story here. The real story is that once again, Mark Zuckerberg has shown a willingness to change direction when needed. The market sees that willingness to change direction as a safety net. If AI succeeds, great, shareholders will reap the rewards. If it fails, Zuckerberg will cut his losses, rightsize the company, and continue to run the world's largest social media empire.\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my Substack for more valuations like this.\n\n",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Date:** 2025-12-16 | **Time Horizon:** Day | **Analyst Perspective:** Senior Market Analyst\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: BEARISH with Defensive/Uncertain Undertones**\n- **Primary Driver:** The S&P 500 decline (per Bloomberg) combined with a mixed jobs report has created uncertainty, reflected in bond market wavering. The VIX at 16.5 indicates elevated, but not panicked, fear.\n- **Retail Sentiment (Reddit):** Bearish tilt. Dominant themes are **economic concern** (oil crash, employment report focus) and **frustration** (flat annual returns despite high trading activity). Mentions of Dr. Burry's silence and FTDs suggest lingering distrust in market structure.\n- **Macro Context:** 10Y Yield at 4.18% with Fed Funds at 3.64% shows a still-inverted yield curve segment, signaling recessionary fears. Oil's collapse is a major deflationary/growth worry signal.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES:**\n- **Commodity Crash & Growth Fears:** WTI oil below $55 (lowest since 2021) is the single loudest data point across all sources. This signals weak global demand, a potential oversupply, and is a deflationary shock hurting energy equities.\n- **Media M&A Drama:** Warner Bros. rejecting Paramount's bid and potentially siding with Netflix is a major consolidation theme in streaming/media. This creates volatility and speculation in entertainment stocks.\n- **Employment Data Uncertainty:** The BLS report is trending, but the professional news calls it \"mixed.\" This leads to confusion on the Fed's path, causing bond market volatility.\n- **Retail Trader Frustration & Speculation:** Reddit shows fatigue (flat annual P&L post) alongside continued niche speculation (LEAPs calls, GameStop mentions). This group is not driving markets but is a sentiment indicator.\n- **Asia-Pacific Weakness & IPO Activity:** Korean Won weakness, Indian Rupee pressure, and mixed APAC IPO performances (HashKey up, Super Bank up) show regional divergence but overall dollar strength pressure.\n- **Structural & Tax Concerns:** Discussions on penny rounding (micro-inflation impact) and billionaire tax rates falling point to underlying societal/economic friction themes.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS:**\n- **Immediate Catalyst:** **Oil Price Collapse.** A break below $55 is a major technical and psychological level. This will pressure energy sector earnings, high-yield energy debt, and inflation expectations.\n- **Bond Market Signal:** The \"wavering\" bonds post-jobs report indicate the market lacks conviction on the economic strength vs. Fed policy trajectory. Watch 10Y Yield holding above 4.15% as a risk-off signal.\n- **Contrarian Indicator:** Extreme moves in micro-cap/small-cap stocks (e.g., VMAR +156%, PAVS -36%) on negligible volume indicate a frothy, speculative, and unstable environment in pockets of the market—often a late-cycle sign.\n- **Corporate Action Signal:** Warner Bros. rejection of Paramount suggests streaming wars are entering a capital-conscious, consolidation phase. Favor scale players.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Demand Shock:** Oil collapse could foreshadow a sharper global slowdown than priced in.\n    2.  **Earnings Compression:** Energy sector woes will spill into Q4 earnings revisions and capex cuts.\n    3.  **Currency Instability:** Emerging market currency weakness (Won, Rupee) could prompt central bank interventions that drain liquidity.\n    4.  **Retail Capitulation:** The frustrated retail sentiment could turn into broader selling if markets break key support levels.\n- **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Defensive Rotation:** Bonds are becoming attractive if growth fears accelerate. Utilities and consumer staples may see inflows.\n    2.  **Dislocation Plays:** Oversold conditions in quality energy names with strong balance sheets (if oil stabilizes).\n    3.  **M&A Arbitrage:** Media sector volatility creates potential merger arbitrage or long-term consolidation bets.\n    4.  **Volatility Hedging:** VIX at 16.5 is relatively cheap for hedging given the macro crosscurrents.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:**\n- **SECTOR: ENERGY - AVOID/UNDERWEIGHT.** The technical and fundamental breakdown in oil is severe. Do not try to catch the falling knife. Wait for a stabilization in volume and a fundamental catalyst (e.g., OPEC+ emergency cut).\n- **SECTOR: MEDIA & ENTERTAINMENT - WATCH FOR CONSOLIDATION.** **NFLX, WBD, PARA:** M&A rumors will drive short-term volatility. Netflix positioned as potential consolidator is a long-term positive.\n- **MACRO: WATCH THE 10Y-2Y SPREAD.** A steepening from its inverted state will signal the market's view on recession timing. Current flat/inverted curve suggests caution.\n- **SYMBOL: GLD (Gold) - HEDGE.** At $395.89, gold is holding as a weak safe haven. A break above $400 on worsening growth fears could signal a new leg up. Consider as a portfolio hedge.\n- **TRADE: LONG VOLATILITY / DEFENSIVE SECTURES.** With VIX moderate and risks rising, consider defined-risk strategies like put spreads on broad indices (SPY, QQQ) or overweight sectors like Utilities (XLU) and Healthcare (XLV).\n- **RISK: REDUCE HIGH-BETA, SPECULATIVE POSITIONS.** The extreme moves in low-volume tickers (VMAR, PAVS) and retail frustration are warning signs. Tighten stop-losses and raise cash.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is reacting to a **growth scare** (oil, mixed data) more than inflation. The tone is defensive. **Tactical moves should favor capital preservation, hedging, and selective sector rotation away from cyclicals until oil finds a floor and bond markets settle.** Monitor the Warner Bros./Paramount/Netflix saga for media sector re-rating.",

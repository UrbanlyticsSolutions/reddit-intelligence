This block carried a base reward of about 3.125 BTC (following the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced mining subsidies), plus additional transaction fees that pushed the total payout slightly higher. The block's hash is 0000000000000000000039a7a8d1b6b3b4f1e8e4f868c4, and it processed over 2,800 transactions, highlighting the ongoing activity on the Bitcoin network despite its immense scale.\n\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/928351\n\nI wouldn’t recommend you trying this though, as you probably will have better odds buying lottery tickets.

      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Friday.",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

The Christmas rally may be quietly approaching.\n\n* NVDA: Buy on dips, await bullish reversal.\n* MSFT: Trading within a range; consider going long only after it returns to 490.\n* AMZN: First stop-loss level at 220, second stop-loss level at 210.\n* AAPL: Look to 276. Only a break above 276 signals an upward trend.\n* GOOG: Faces resistance at 305. Look for a rebound near 310 to turn bullish; otherwise, remain bearish.\n* META: Wait for a pullback near 660 to confirm new support before going long.\n* TSLA: Facing strong resistance at 490, unable to boost valuation. Holders may consider liquidating positions to enjoy the holidays. Not a Musk supporter? Avoid chasing the price higher here.",

But Google's TPU performance shows that big techs can rely on their own custom chips rather than buying from Nvidia or AMD.

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions. These bonds would likely be best suited in a retirement account due to the federal, state, and local tax implications.",

      "content": "Clustered 10b5-1 plan adoptions at Wave Life Sciences, normal or notable?\n\nI’m looking for feedback from people who’ve looked at insider trading patterns before.\n\nWave Life Sciences (WVE) stock jumped \\~3x on December 8 following positive interim trial results. On that same day, 8 executives/directors executed stock sales under 10b5-1 plans. I understand the same-day execution is plausibly explained by price-based triggers or limit orders.\n\nHowever, I saw that the 8 plans that executed on December 8 were initiated in two clusters:\n\n* 3 plans on March 13, 2025\n* 5 plans on August 6, 2025\n\nI pulled Form 4 data for Wave from 2024–2025 to look closer at this pattern and wrote up the details here [https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/](https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/)\n\nMy question:  \nI'm relatively new to this. Is this kind of clustered 10b5-1 adoption and execution fairly typical in biotech or other industries? Is this easily explained by compensation cycles/normal planning, or is this something you’d flag as worth a second look? \n\nI haven't yet benchmarked against a larger sample of biotech companies, that's on my list if this is indeed notable.",

Though its achievements were often overshadowed by giants like Nvidia and AMD, Micron's stock performance significantly outpaced both rivals in 2025. Year to date, Micron shares have surged nearly 200%, compared to Nvidia's 28% gain and AMD's 65% increase.\n\nWhat's your target price for MU?",

      "content": "Is there a good list of ways/tricks/systems for minimizing tax impact from a concentrated position?\n\nCurious, since this is seemingly a common problem in tech, when a company goes IPO, suddenly someone has a large amount of their net worth in a single position, but due to high salaries + volume of positions, diversifying causes 50% of that to evaporate if they were to sell.\n\nIs there a good place to read on ways people get around this, if the goal is to stay invested, just diversified?\n\nFor example, I am aware of [Exchange Funds](https://advisor.morganstanley.com/the-horizons-group/documents/field/h/ho/horizons-group/Exchange_Funds.pdf), which basically signs a contract to enter some fund by giving your individual stocks for rights to a larger pool of stocks, creating diversification without a sale event. Issue usually is that your stock needs to be part of an exchange fund in order to participate, so options here are limited.\n\nThe thread about [\"enhanced direct indexing\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1pqoqbb/is_enhanced_direct_indexing_the_right_choice_for/) sparked my interest as well, but seems a little less straight forward since it seems to rely on taking a loan to buy a wide set of stocks via Direct Indexing, and then waiting for some of them to be \"losses\" that you can sell as you slowly unwind your loans and pull out of your concentrated position.\n\nDoes anyone have other sources? [Fidelity's generic article](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/wealth-management-insights/diversify-concentrated-positions) seems to not really know of much beyond what we discussed already.",

Now I find myself in a position where a large percentage of my portfolio is in this single security and I'm looking to diversify.\n\nI have been told that enhanced direct indexing is a good option for unwinding a concentrated position. I'm a novice here but if I understand it correctly, for a non-trivial fee, a management firm will use my concentrated position as leverage to buy long and short positions and use tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains, effectively diversifying while deferring the large taxable event.\n\nAre there big inherent risks I'm not aware of? Are there other options I should consider? I recognize there's a real risk by having nearly half of my portfolio in a single security but I don't want to make a mistake and take an even greater risk trying to unwind it. \n\nThanks!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 12:32:06  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT  \n**Overall Sentiment: Cautiously Bullish with Elevated Macro Risks**  \n\n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Mixed but leaning speculative/defensive. High engagement on macro risks (Japan yields, national debt, \"witching day\") and meme-stock nostalgia (GME, AMZN vs. GME). Retail traders appear focused on volatility catalysts and anti-establishment narratives (e.g., \"tax the rich,\" \"media FUD\").  \n- **News Sentiment:** Bloomberg headlines suggest a \"Santa Rally\" narrative remains intact, but noise in data (e.g., \"Data Is Very Noisy\") and event-driven stories (Trump/drugmakers, Petroperu stress) introduce uncertainty.  \n- **Market Data:** NVDA (+3.61%) and BBAI (+11.28%) show risk-on momentum in tech/AI, while SOXS (-8.95%) indicates short-covering in semiconductors. VIX at 16.87 is elevated but not panicked.  \n- **Macro Backdrop:** 10Y yield at 4.16% and Fed Funds at 3.64% reflect tight monetary policy; inflation data (CPI 325.031) shows persistent pressures.  \n\n**Verdict:** Short-term bullish bias (Santa Rally, tech strength) but heavily contingent on macro developments (BOJ, options expiry, data revisions).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES  \n**A. Macro Policy Divergence & Debt Concerns**  \n- BOJ hiking to 30-year highs (Reddit #11) and Japan’s 10Y yield >2% (Reddit #2) signal a major regime shift, potentially draining global liquidity.  \n- U.S. national debt ($38T) and interest payments >$1T annually (Reddit #10) are fueling intergenerational tension (Reddit #12) and long-term fiscal risks.  \n\n**B. Data Reliability & Inflation Surprises**  \n- Suspicion around government data (Reddit #7: \"assumes Zero Housing Inflation\") echoes Bloomberg’s \"Data Is Very Noisy,\" creating uncertainty for Fed policy and market pricing.  \n\n**C. Retail Speculation & Meme-Stock Resurgence**  \n- GME references (Reddit #5, #8) and \"mining\" windfalls (Reddit #6) indicate renewed retail interest in high-beta, narrative-driven trades.  \n\n**D. Event-Driven Volatility Catalysts**  \n- \"Record Witching Day\" (Reddit #9) suggests Friday’s options expiry could amplify moves.  \n- Trump/drugmaker deal (News #3) and DraftKings prediction markets (News #9) are sector-specific catalysts.  \n\n**E. Corporate & Credit Stress**  \n- Petroperu bonds slumping (News #4), Colorado steel mill halting shipments (Reddit #14), and NIKE \"nuking\" after hours (Reddit #15) point to idiosyncratic risks in commodities, industrials, and consumer discretionary.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS  \n**Bullish Signals:**  \n- **Santa Rally narrative** still alive (Bloomberg #2).  \n- **Tech leadership:** NVDA breaking out, BBAI rallying on AI/defense themes.  \n- **VIX subdued** relative to macro noise, suggesting institutional complacency or hedging.  \n\n**Bearish/Risk Signals:**  \n- **BOJ tightening:** Could strengthen JPY, weaken USD, and pressure global equity valuations.  \n- **High yields:** 10Y at 4.16% may limit equity upside unless earnings accelerate.  \n- **Options expiry (12/19):** Potential for gamma squeezes or unwinds.  \n- **Credit stress:** Petroperu, Nike after-hours drop signal pockets of weakness.  \n\n**Catalysts to Watch Today:**  \n- Options expiry (\"witching day\").  \n- BOJ policy ripple effects.  \n- Any inflation/data revisions (after Reddit skepticism).  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Liquidity Drain:** BOJ exiting ultra-easy policy may reduce global dollar liquidity, pressuring risk assets.  \n2. **Data Disconnects:** If official data is perceived as unreliable, market reactions could become erratic.  \n3. **Retail FOMO:** Meme-stock mania could return, increasing volatility in low-float, high-short-interest names.  \n4. **Fiscal Overhang:** Debt/deficit concerns may eventually trigger a bond market sell-off or rating downgrades.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Tech Momentum:** AI/data center theme remains robust (NVDA, BBAI).  \n2. **Volatility Trades:** Elevated VIX and event risk support options strategies.  \n3. **Defensive Rotations:** Utilities, consumer staples may benefit if yields spike.  \n4. **Short Credit:** Selective shorts in stressed credits (e.g., Petroperu, distressed corporates).  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n\n**SECTOR: Technology** – Favor AI/data center exposure (NVDA, BBAI) but tighten stops; momentum is strong but vulnerable to macro shifts.  \n\n**SECTOR: Financials** – Monitor Japanese banks and global insurers benefiting from higher yields; avoid regional U.S. banks if debt concerns escalate.  \n\n**SYMBOL: GME** – Watch for gamma squeeze potential into options expiry; retail chatter is rising but fundamentals remain weak. High-risk, tactical only.  \n\n**SYMBOL: NIKE** – Investigate after-hours drop for broader consumer discretionary read; consider shorting peers if weakness spreads.  \n\n**MACRO: USD/JPY** – Expect volatility as BOJ policy shift unfolds; potential JPY strengthening could pressure dollar-denominated assets.  \n\n**TRADE: Volatility Hedge** – Given \"witching day\" and data noise, consider long VIX calls or put spreads on indices for tail protection.  \n\n**AVOID: Low-Grade Corporate Bonds** – Petroperu stress signals emerging market credit risks; stay selective in high-yield.  \n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** The market is balancing a year-end rally against mounting macro headwinds. **Stay nimble—favor momentum trades with defined risk, hedge for event volatility, and watch Japan for systemic cues.** Retail sentiment is noisy but can drive short-term squeezes; institutional flows will likely determine the broader trend.",

This block carried a base reward of about 3.125 BTC (following the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced mining subsidies), plus additional transaction fees that pushed the total payout slightly higher. The block's hash is 0000000000000000000039a7a8d1b6b3b4f1e8e4f868c4, and it processed over 2,800 transactions, highlighting the ongoing activity on the Bitcoin network despite its immense scale.\n\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/928351\n\nI wouldn’t recommend you trying this though, as you probably will have better odds buying lottery tickets.

      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

      "content": "Musk wins appeal and restores 2018 Tesla pay deal worth $56 billion\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Delaware's Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package from Tesla, which was once valued at $56 billion. Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.”\n\nThe ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThis compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November.\n\nThe ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares.\n\nMusk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock.\n\nIn 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded.\n\nMusk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies.\n\nTesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands.\n\nIn November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales.\n\nTesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan.\n\nThe Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

I’m especially interested in content that goes beyond mechanics and focuses on **how great investors think** about businesses, valuation, and capital allocation.\n\nI really enjoy long-form, thoughtful analysis like Ben Thompson’s *Stratechery* — clear frameworks, business model breakdowns, and well-reasoned opinions — and I’m hoping to find something similar that’s **specifically focused on value investing**.\n\nI’m open to free or paid blogs, newsletters, or investor letters with a strong fundamentals and long-term orientation. Less interested in short-term market commentary or opaque stock-picking services.\n\nIf there are any consistently high-signal writers or platforms you’d recommend, I’d love to hear them.",

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions. These bonds would likely be best suited in a retirement account due to the federal, state, and local tax implications.",

      "content": "Clustered 10b5-1 plan adoptions at Wave Life Sciences, normal or notable?\n\nI’m looking for feedback from people who’ve looked at insider trading patterns before.\n\nWave Life Sciences (WVE) stock jumped \\~3x on December 8 following positive interim trial results. On that same day, 8 executives/directors executed stock sales under 10b5-1 plans. I understand the same-day execution is plausibly explained by price-based triggers or limit orders.\n\nHowever, I saw that the 8 plans that executed on December 8 were initiated in two clusters:\n\n* 3 plans on March 13, 2025\n* 5 plans on August 6, 2025\n\nI pulled Form 4 data for Wave from 2024–2025 to look closer at this pattern and wrote up the details here [https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/](https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/)\n\nMy question:  \nI'm relatively new to this. Is this kind of clustered 10b5-1 adoption and execution fairly typical in biotech or other industries? Is this easily explained by compensation cycles/normal planning, or is this something you’d flag as worth a second look? \n\nI haven't yet benchmarked against a larger sample of biotech companies, that's on my list if this is indeed notable.",

I don't know if this is old news or if this is something that might be the next sector that is trending other than semiconductors. In my opinion I think the tech side is slowing down and only so much can be innovated when it comes to GPUs, Semis, we are now seeing RAM prices go up with data centers being built. But with data centers being built rumor has it the US power grid can barely keep up with winter (Texas / Illinois specifically) and black outs in summer. \n\nI was eyeing a few energy stocks ($BE, FSLR, GEV, BESF ETF) but I was wondering if these are already priced in? Is energy sector something that is lacking or can money be made in this sector? \n\nI think FSLR will be slower as solar can only do so much. $BE might be the way to go, GEV looks like it has amazing potential and BESF ETF too but I don't have the data on whats comprised in that ETF. (FINVIZ Subscription ran out)\n\n$BE also crashed with the rumor when SPACE X goes public they will put data centers in space, but the argument is space is cold and imo that idea is far fetched just to get Space X in the spot light. \n\nA month ago I was eyeing data center construction stocks but now with the US infrastructure I think energy might be the next trending sector?

Now I find myself in a position where a large percentage of my portfolio is in this single security and I'm looking to diversify.\n\nI have been told that enhanced direct indexing is a good option for unwinding a concentrated position. I'm a novice here but if I understand it correctly, for a non-trivial fee, a management firm will use my concentrated position as leverage to buy long and short positions and use tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains, effectively diversifying while deferring the large taxable event.\n\nAre there big inherent risks I'm not aware of? Are there other options I should consider? I recognize there's a real risk by having nearly half of my portfolio in a single security but I don't want to make a mistake and take an even greater risk trying to unwind it. \n\nThanks!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 15:01:59 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Cautiously Bearish with Elevated Anxiety**\nThe sentiment is **bearish-leaning**, driven by macro fears and retail skepticism, but with pockets of speculative momentum.\n*   **Reddit (Retail Sentiment):** Dominated by warnings (FUD, \"witching day,\" debt concerns), skepticism toward official data (\"Zero Housing Inflation\"), and defensive memes (Buffett's \"fat pitch\"). The tone is anxious and distrustful of institutions.\n*   **Macro Data:** Supports caution. The 10Y Treasury Yield at **4.12%** and Japan's yield crossing **2%** (a Reddit highlight) signal persistent global rate pressures. The elevated US Equity Risk Premium (**4.33%**) indicates the market is demanding higher compensation for risk.\n*   **Contradiction:** This anxiety coexists with strong momentum in specific tech/AI names (e.g., **NVDA +3.93%**) and speculative retail plays (e.g., mining gains post), creating a fragmented, volatile environment.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES: Macro Distrust, AI Spend, and Speculative Fragmentation**\n*   **Macroeconomic Distrust & Fiscal Fear:** The dominant theme. Reddit is focused on debt ($38T, $1T+ interest), generational wealth transfer, and质疑 government data (CPI/housing). This aligns with the high 10Y yield and ERP.\n*   **AI as a Capital Allocation Mandate:** Confirmed by both news (\"AI The Largest Spend Item for 2026\") and market performance (**NVDA** strength). This is the clear, sustained institutional theme cutting through the noise.\n*   **Retail Speculation vs. Institutional Reality:** A stark divide. Reddit discusses meme stocks (**GME**), mining windfalls, and \"old school\" trades, while institutional news focuses on AI, IPO pipelines (**Medtronic** spinoff), and emerging market cycles.\n*   **Event-Driven Volatility Catalysts:** \"Record Witching Day\" (quadruple expiry) and the **DOJ Epstein files** release are near-term volatility triggers noted across sources.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS AND CATALYSTS**\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (Today):** **\"Record Witching Day\"** – Expect elevated volatility and volume into the close as massive options positions expire.\n*   **Interest Rate Signal:** **Japan's 10Y > 2%** is a major global macro shift, potentially pulling capital and tightening financial conditions worldwide. Reinforces the \"higher for longer\" narrative.\n*   **Inflation Data Skepticism:** The debate over November housing data (\"assumes Zero Housing Inflation\") will keep Fed policy expectations volatile, impacting rate-sensitive sectors.\n*   **Liquidity & Sentiment Gauge:** **VIX at 16.87** is elevated but not panicked, suggesting managed anxiety. The surge in **LAZR (+174.73%)** on low volume is a classic low-float, high-speculation retail signal, indicating risk-seeking in pockets.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Macro Policy Mistrust:** If skepticism toward official data widens, it could destabilize bond markets and increase volatility premiums.\n    2.  **Global Yield Synchronization:** Japan exiting ultra-low yield policy adds a new layer of global liquidity tightening.\n    3.  **Event Volatility:** The options expiry and Epstein news drip are unpredictable volatility sources.\n    4.  **Concentration Risk:** Market leadership remains dangerously narrow (AI/NVDA). A rotation or stumble could leave few places to hide.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **AI Infrastructure & Spend:** Companies enabling AI adoption are receiving mandated capital allocation. This trend is validated across news and price action.\n    2.  **Emerging Markets (EM):** News suggests EM may be \"Starting Bull Cycle.\" This could be an early rotation play if U.S. macro fears deepen.\n    3.  **Volatility Harvesting:** Elevated VIX and event catalysts create opportunities for structured options strategies (though Reddit's \"ThetaGang Goes Wrong\" post serves as a retail warning).\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n*   **SECTOR: AI & Semiconductors** – Maintain core exposure but be selective. The Teneo CEO's comment confirms 2026 budgets are being set for AI. This is a multi-quarter theme. **Watch for earnings guidance** from software and infrastructure players.\n*   **SYMBOL: NVDA** – The bellwether. Its strength (+3.93% today) is the counterpoint to broad market anxiety. **Watch $180 as key support.** A break below could signal a broader tech risk-off move.\n*   **MACRO: U.S. Treasuries (TLT)** – The 10Y yield at 4.12% is attractive for income, but **duration risk remains high** amid volatile inflation data and supply concerns ($38T debt). Favor short-to-intermediate duration for now.\n*   **TRADE: Volatility (VIX/Options)** – With \"Witching Day\" and episodic news shocks (Epstein files), **consider defined-risk option strategies** (e.g., iron condors, calendar spreads) to harvest elevated premium, especially in indices. Avoid naked short volatility.\n*   **WATCH: Emerging Markets (EEM/VWO)** – The \"starting bull cycle\" comment from Jamison (Bloomberg) is a notable divergence call. **Monitor for relative strength vs. S&P 500** as a potential early rotation signal.\n*   **AVOID: Low-Float Speculative Frenzies (e.g., LAZR)** – Extreme moves like LAZR's +174% on negligible volume are liquidity traps for retail. These are signals of speculative froth, not investment opportunities.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is navigating a **\"Schizophrenic Macro\"** – institutional capital is plowing into the secular AI trend while retail sentiment is bogged down in macro despair and debt fears. The key is to **separate the cyclical noise from the secular signal.** Prioritize quality within the AI/tech spend theme, manage duration risk in fixed income, and use elevated volatility strategically, not speculatively. The **close today will be critical** due to options expiry.",

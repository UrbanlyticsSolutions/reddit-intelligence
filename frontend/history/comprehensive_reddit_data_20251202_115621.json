Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026.\n\nGiannandrea will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft. Before that, he worked at Google’s DeepMind, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nSubramanya will be Apple’s vice president of AI, the company said, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple said Giannandrea would remain as an advisor until next spring.\n\nIn a statement, Cook said that Federighi already played a key role in Apple’s AI efforts. Federighi is Apple’s top software executive.\n\n“In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,” Cook said in a statement.\n\nSubramanya will lead teams at Apple working on the company’s foundation models, research, and AI safety, the company said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai.html)",

      "content": "Amazon releases an impressive new AI chip and teases a Nvidia-friendly roadmap\n\nAmazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs.\nThe cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at its AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product in on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.\n\nAWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation, according to AWS.\nAWS says the systems are more than four times faster, with four times more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10 times the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. \nPerhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation.  While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.\nIt is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscience way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  \nAWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, Splashmusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. \n\n\nAWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step-up in performance and support Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  \nThis means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon’s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  \nIt’s worth noting, too, that Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), has become the de facto standard that all AI apps support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon’s cloud.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/",

Should I borrow more?\n\n[Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l9z4yl/i_borrowed_5m_to_invest_should_i_borrow_more/), I had a $2.1M account with $1M in gains.\n\nIn 6 months, the account grew another **+$470K** so I'm at **+$1.5M** of total gains [since my first post 5 and a half years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/). I did withdraw $250K to buy a new home, so the account sits at $2.3M.\n\n[Ending - Net Deposits = +$1.5M in gains](https://preview.redd.it/322xfhvafn4g1.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8021b1db3c461e3dc6645fdaac8c026e4e3f7eb0)\n\n  \n That's a +27% compound return a year for nearly 6 years. I continue to crush regular, r/stock boomer index fund portfolios:\n\n[I \\(blue\\) am +263&amp;#37; while stocks \\(green\\) are barely +100&amp;#37; over that time period](https://preview.redd.it/hlqiqv1lfn4g1.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc12e2fdda95efb9aef3ec2899f5d6849aaa38c7)\n\nThe account has $7.3M assets and $5M borrowed in options so that's **3.2x** leverage. I'm under-leveraged, I know. The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage. I haven't decided.\n\nSummary:\n\n\\- Borrow 2-4x the value of your account on margin.\n\n\\- Dump it all in a multi-asset, diversified portfolio. For the stock sleeve, I prefer smart-beta funds due to their higher expected returns. **The goal is maximum compound returns.**\n\n[Positions: Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and $5M borrowed in Box Spread Options](https://preview.redd.it/a9q7blx3sn4g1.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d605f7cd0a610c53acd85f9236514de55ad7b)\n\n\n\nQ&amp;A\n\n1) *When will you de-lever/pay-off the debt/liquidate?*\n\n\\- Never. This maximizes returns. Why do anything but this?\n\n2) *What's it like for your account to grow +$1M per year?*\n\n\\- It's cool, you should try it. Save what you can, invest it like this and give it time. I started with just $20K in 2017.\n\n*3) Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere?*\n\n\\- I have every penny riding in here. Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27% per year so why do that?",

      "content": "Michael Burry Calls Out Tesla Stating They Are \"Ridiculously Overvalued\"\n\n“Big Short” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter, calling the electric-vehicle maker “ridiculously overvalued” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern. Burry argued that Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders.\n\nBurry cited Tesla’s SEC filings showing that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market.\n\nHe noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution.\n\nBurry also referenced Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards.\n\nTesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels. Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.",

If Amazon can offer decent performance for less, there’s definitely a market for it.\n\nBut there’s a catch.  \nTrainium3 doesn’t have anything close to Nvidia’s software ecosystem. CUDA and the entire Nvidia stack are still massive moats, and they’re the reason companies can deploy models quickly without rewriting everything.

      "content": "Is the entire stock market basically a giant confidence game and what happens the day people stop believing in it?\n\nHonestly I’ve been thinking about this way too much lately… sometimes the whole stock market feels like it only works because everyone keeps pretending it works. Like literally the whole thing runs on “confidence,” “sentiment,” “vibes,” whatever you wanna call it. Earnings matter yeah, interest rates matter yeah, but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it’s worth buying. People hold because they trust it’ll go back up. People panic because they think someone else is panicking.\n\nIt’s like one giant circular trust fall. Everyone is basically agreeing not to look down.\n\nAnd then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense? Like not a normal recession or correction, but a day where enough people say “nah I’m done trusting this casino.” Would everything just… unwind? Would indexes tank for years? Would governments step in and force something? Or does the system somehow survive because it’s too big to fail, like people will keep believing simply because they have no choice?\n\nIdk maybe I’m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is. Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating?",

      "content": "A 'seismic' Nvidia shift, AI chip shortages and how it's threatening to hike gadget prices\n\nAnalysts are starting to flag a new concern: the AI boom is beginning to strain global chip supply chains in a way that could eventually push up the cost of consumer electronics — including smartphones. AI data centers require massive numbers of GPUs and supporting components, and companies like Nvidia, AMD, Google, and Microsoft are all drawing from the same pool of suppliers. As demand accelerates, several parts of the supply chain are struggling to keep up. Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu recently described the situation as “undersupply,” pointing to shortages across chip manufacturers, memory suppliers, and storage device makers and said the bottleneck could last two to three years.\n\nConsultants at Bain &amp; Company highlighted two immediate pressure points: **Hard disk drives (HDDs):** Hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft have pushed HDD capacity to the limit. **Solid-state drives (SSDs):** With HDDs running short, big cloud companies are shifting toward SSDs the same components used in consumer electronics. On top of that, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a stacked version of DRAM crucial for Nvidia’s latest AI chips, is also in tight supply. These constraints ripple backward through the semiconductor ecosystem and raise the cost of parts used in everyday devices. As AI infrastructure spending surges, several key components are facing multi-year shortages. That raises the risk of higher prices — or even limited availability — for some consumer tech products if supply doesn’t catch up soon.",

      "content": "Masayoshi Son Regrets Nvidia Exit but Says SoftBank Needed Capital for OpenAI Push\n\nMasayoshi Son opened up on Monday about SoftBank’s decision to sell its entire Nvidia stake and he didn’t sugarcoat how he felt about it. Speaking at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo, Son said he “was crying” as SoftBank offloaded the stock, which brought in roughly $5.83 billion.\nAccording to Son, the sale wasn’t about lack of confidence in Nvidia. Instead, SoftBank needed the capital to fuel massive upcoming AI investments, including larger bets on OpenAI, data-center infrastructure under the Stargate Project, and its chip ambitions via Ampere Computing. Son reiterated that SoftBank is “all in” on AI and hinted that the firm may expand its OpenAI investment depending on future valuations. SoftBank’s focus on AI has already paid off the conglomerate’s Q2 net profit more than doubled, aided by valuation gains tied to OpenAI. Despite growing market concerns about a potential AI bubble, Son dismissed the skepticism, saying those calling it a bubble are “not smart enough.” He predicts that advanced AI systems and AI robotics could eventually generate at least 10% of global GDP, justifying the scale of current investment.For Son, selling Nvidia shares wasn’t a statement about the chip giant it was a sacrifice to fund what he sees as the next wave of global technological transformation.",

He frequently referenced the market being way too expensive consistently sitting at 20-25X earnings, and mentioned several times that the USA had reached its “apex” (peak) and indexes may not be wise investments as the nation may see prolonged stagnation in terms of growth and earnings — which is why he spent the last chapters of his life seeking value in China, which seemed to disappoint him just as many times as it helped him due to the strict corporate regulations and oversight. \n\nI know it’s just one grumpy old man’s opinion, but it’s very disheartening to see a man who went from bankrupt to billionaire in a little over 30 years, largely through marketable securities, almost blow off the future of investing. He stated numerous times that the upcoming generation should be ready for a lot of disappointment in the markets. \n\nThoughts?",

This chess move by NVDA will shift the R&amp;D hardware standard from CPUs to GPUs, thus creating a new secondary moat for NVDA.\n\nThe rest of the Mag7 (AMZN, AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL and TSLA) are using Synopsis EDA software to design their custom silicon (Trainium, M-series, MTIA, Maia, TPU and AI5/6). The NVDA AI GPUs will fast track the design output, however there would be a design bias (via training data and hardware optimisation) that would result in the custom silicon chips being similar to NVDA GPUs. This is a defensive play to prevent the rise of non-GPU disruptive custom silicon. Also, increases the NVDA CUDA moat.\n\nExciting times ahead!",

When including October, November, and December (i.e., Q4), this proportion soars to 71% (9% + 9% + 53%).\n\nAs year-end approaches, fund managers must present their performance to LPs. To make their year-end reports look impressive, they tend to buy the year's best-performing stocks and sell underperforming ones. This collective behavior drives up the prices of strong stocks, pushing the index higher and artificially creating peaks toward the end of the year.\n\nAt the same time, many listed companies plan their share repurchase authorizations on an annual basis. If the budget remains unused by Q4, CFOs often accelerate buybacks in the open market, providing substantial liquidity support to the market.\n\nWhen the market performs reasonably well in the first three quarters, underinvested funds face performance pressure to chase the rally toward year-end, especially around the Christmas period.\n\nStocks w/ potential: NVDA, BGM, WBUY, VRT, HOOD\n\nNot financial advice.",

This is money I have plans for in the short term, so I want to keep it invested conservatively.\n\nMy question is, am I better off investing in NY munis instead? I know you need to consider tax brackets, but when looking at the current yield for VNYTX, it is very close and maybe even more then SGOV. So if the yield is the same, tax brackets don't really matter, why wouldn't you invest in VNYTX and save on both Fed AND State tax?\n\nI know there must be a catch or reason, I just don't know what it is.

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-02 11:55:29 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral-to-Cautious, with Elevated Retail Speculation**\n\nThe data paints a mixed picture. **Institutional and macro signals lean cautious**, with a 10Y Treasury yield at 4.02% above the Fed Funds Rate (3.89%), a flat/inverted yield curve dynamic that historically signals economic caution. The VIX at 17.24 is elevated but not panicked, suggesting heightened vigilance. However, **retail sentiment (via Reddit) is buzzing with speculative fervor**, focused on meme stocks (GME), crypto (Bitcoin, MSTR), and large single-stock gains (MongoDB). This divergence suggests a market where institutional players are assessing macro risks while retail traders chase volatility, creating potential for sharp, sentiment-driven moves.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES: **Policy Uncertainty, Tech Sector Crosscurrents, & Retail Speculation**\n\n*   **Policy & Regulatory Uncertainty:** A dominant theme. Discussions on Trump-era tariff refunds (Costco lawsuits), a potential dovish Fed policy shift under a new chair, and SEC regulatory scrutiny (CME outage) point to significant policy fluidity impacting corporate costs and market structure.\n*   **Tech Sector Dichotomy:** Contrasting narratives emerge. **Bearish signals** include Michael Burry's \"ridiculously overvalued\" call on Tesla and Apple's AI chief stepping down. **Bullish catalysts** include Samsung's massive 60% memory chip price hike (positive for semiconductor suppliers like MU, but a cost headwind for device makers) and continued retail interest in names like NVDA (up 0.9%).\n*   **Retail Speculation & \"Gamification\":** Reddit trends highlight a resurgence in meme stock activity (GME warrants), crypto mania (Bitcoin shorts at risk), and discussions on Robinhood's interface encouraging trading as gambling. This indicates a risk-on, momentum-chasing segment of the market detached from fundamental news.\n*   **Economic Health Scrutiny:** Concerns linger beneath the surface, with Reddit topics questioning Black Friday spending strength and highlighting the narrow leadership of the \"S&P 493\" (implying a top-heavy market). The RSS news on \"Artificial Christmas Trees Face Real Headwinds\" is a microcosm of potential consumer softness.\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS AND CATALYSTS\n\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (Bullish for Semis):** **Samsung's 60% memory price hike** is a major supply-side shock. This is a direct, powerful bullish signal for memory chip producers (MU, WDC) and semiconductor equipment. It may pressure margins for downstream hardware companies.\n*   **Monetary Policy Catalyst:** Traders are actively **\"pricing in a dovish Fed policy shift\"** under a new Chair. This is a key macro pivot point that could support asset prices if confirmed.\n*   **Liquidation Risk Signal (Crypto):** Bitcoin nearing **$96.9K could trigger $9.6B in short liquidations**. This is a known volatility amplifier that could spill over into related equity proxies (MSTR, COIN).\n*   **Warning Signal (Valuation):** **Michael Burry's Tesla short call** is a high-profile warning on extreme valuation in a bellwether speculative growth name. It may dampen sentiment in high-multiple tech.\n*   **Technical Signal:** The **US Equity Risk Premium of 4.33%** is moderate. Combined with the 10Y yield > Fed Funds Rate, it suggests equity markets are not pricing in significant distress, but the risk-reward is not compellingly cheap either.\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n### **Primary Risks:**\n1.  **Policy Whiplash:** Tariff rulings, sudden regulatory actions (e.g., SEC on crypto/clearing), or a Fed pivot that disappoints expectations could spark volatility.\n2.  **Speculative Unwind:** The concentration of retail interest in highly volatile, low-liquidity assets (meme stocks, crypto) poses a risk of a sharp, correlated sell-off if sentiment sours.\n3.  **Economic Divergence:** The \"S&P 493\" narrative and Black Friday skepticism signal a fragile, uneven consumer economy that may not support broad market multiples.\n4.  **Sector-Specific Disruption:** Apple's AI leadership change introduces execution risk in its critical AI roadmap.\n\n### **Primary Opportunities:**\n1.  **Semiconductor Supply Chain:** The memory chip shortage and price surge create a clear, fundamental tailwind for memory manufacturers and related equipment/tech.\n2.  **Policy Beneficiaries:** Companies like Costco actively litigating for tariff refunds represent potential for one-time cash flow boosts if successful.\n3.  **Volatility Harvesting:** Elevated VIX and disparate market narratives (calm macro vs. frenzied retail) increase the value of tactical, volatility-based strategies.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n\n*   **SECTOR: Semiconductors (Memory) - BULLISH**\n    *   **Insight:** Samsung's 60% price hike is a profound industry catalyst. Favor direct memory exposure (e.g., **MU**) and semiconductor capital equipment. Be wary of hardware OEMs facing margin compression.\n\n*   **SYMBOL: MSTR / COIN - HIGH RISK MONITOR**\n    *   **Insight:** These are direct proxies for Bitcoin sentiment. The $9.6B short liquidation level near $96.9K is a critical technical and sentiment threshold. A breach could fuel a massive, but potentially short-lived, squeeze. Position for extreme volatility.\n\n*   **SYMBOL: TSLA - CAUTION**\n    *   **Insight:** Burry's high-profile short call, while not new, gains traction in a cautious tape. It reinforces existing negative narratives (competition, valuation). Avoid new long entries; consider it a sentiment barometer for speculative growth.\n\n*   **THEME: Policy Arbitrage - WATCH**\n    *   **Insight:** Monitor Supreme Court developments on Trump-era tariffs. A ruling in favor of companies like **COST** could trigger positive, stock-specific reactions. Also, track any official commentary from the incoming Fed Chair for confirmation of the \"dovish shift.\"\n\n*   **MARKET: Volatility Positioning - NEUTRAL**\n    *   **Insight:** The VIX level suggests buying broad-market protection is moderately priced. Given the retail speculation in corners of the market, consider **sector-specific or single-name option strategies** rather than broad index hedges, as a market melt-up driven by retail frenzy remains possible alongside macro caution.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is in a state of tension between macro caution and micro speculation. **The most actionable, fundamental signal is the semiconductor memory price shock.** Trade around this clarity while managing risk from the volatile, sentiment-driven moves in meme and crypto-related assets. Policy developments are the key unknown that could tip the broader market's balance.",

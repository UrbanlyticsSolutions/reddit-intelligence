      "content": "\"There is no way that the U.S. oil production data is correct.\" Anonymous comment\n\nBeen wondering about all the data points the administration has been putting out, but the oil production numbers have been a little strange.\n\nOil production is increasing every month, except May, in 2025. Strange is that I couldn't find another year that happened. Probably because it's nearly impossible to have increasing production month after month after month. (Please correct me if I'm wrong)\n\nHere is the data:  \n[https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=M](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=M)\n\nDallas Fed Energy Survey Dec 17, 2025 where the quote was taken. It's anonymous BTW.\n\n[https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/des/2025/2504#tab-comments](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/des/2025/2504#tab-comments)",

      "content": "The first time I used a crypto-backed loan.... it felt like cheating.\n\nLast winter I tried a crypto-backed loan because I didn’t want to sell my coins. I locked up about $10,000 worth of BTC and borrowed $5,500 cash. The app called that “55% LTV”. All it means is: loan divided by collateral value.\n\nThe terms said a warning would hit around 70% and an auto-sell could happen around 80%. I read it, nodded, and moved on. Big mistake. Because the math changes fast when price drops.\n\nThat night BTC slid hard. My $10,000 collateral became roughly $7,800 in a few hours. My loan was still $5,500, so my LTV jumped to about 70%+. I got a message: “margin call, 24 hours to cure.” Cure means add more collateral or repay part of the loan.\n\nI tried adding $1,000 more BTC from another wallet. Network fees were spiking and my transfer sat pending. I tried repaying $500 instead, but my bank transfer wouldn’t clear instantly. Support chat replied like “high volume, expect delays.” The timer didn’t care.\n\nBy morning the app showed “partial liquidation executed.” They sold a chunk of my BTC to push the ratio back down, then charged an execution fee on what they sold. I wasn’t wiped out, but I did sell at the worst moment without choosing to.\n\nIf you ever use these loans, assume a 30% drop can happen any random day. Borrow lower than you think, keep extra collateral ready, and make sure you can move money fast.",

      "content": "NBIS; An Opportunity To Be A Generational Bag Holder\n\nHere is a company whose core business revolves around purchasing costly depreciating GPUs and renting their output out to hyper scalers such as Microsoft at a loss.\n\nTheir subsidiaries are arguably nothing but money-sinks (Clickhouse, AVride, etc.) and are outclassed by numerous competitors such as Snowflake, Starship Technologies, etc.\n\nWhile Revenue has grown 300%+ year over year, expenses have grown at a faster rate and the company is essentially burning through money.\n\n1. Secure a contract at a loss -&gt; \n\n2. Use contract to get a loan/funding -&gt; \n\n3. Build out infrastructure/acquire GPUs -&gt; \n\n4. Repeat -&gt; \n\n5. Hope to eventually become a competing AWS alternative for AI cloud solutions.\n\nThe problem: \n\nToday, the overwhelming majority of NBIS's revenue comes from hyper scalers looking to offload demand. NBIS is providing them the compute at a loss. \n\nAt anytime a hyperscaler(s) can choose to no longer use NBIS when unfavorable, which will completely cripple the company's finances.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are currently investing extremely heavily into their own data centers to keep up with demand, so the chance of Nebius acquiring customers that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, can't provide supply to in the future is low.\n\nThere is also huge uncertainty regarding NBIS's future cashflows, demand, and financial solvency. Shareholders may unknowingly be diluted to raise funds, a forced buy-out can happen, etc.\n\nOverall, NBIS is a great opportunity to become a generational bag holder. Simply ignore the financials and choose to invest off of vibes, chasing hype, etc., and you may potentially find yourself holding a bag for years to come.",

There have only been four years since 1938 where the S&amp;P 500 total return was -18% or worse. 1974, 2002, 2008, and 2022. So 4/87 years. Yes, 18% is somewhat cherry picked and of course cumulative peak to trough drawdowns have been much worse than 18%. But if you bought on the close of the last day of the trading year, you only lost 18% or more over the next 12 months 4.6% of the time.\n2. The S&amp;P 500 PEG ratio is currently 1.2 which is roughly about average since 1995. It was above 1.6 in 2016. Above 1.5 in 2004. And above 1.4 for much of the 2010s. It even got to 2.0 in 2023 but quickly reversed.\n3. The stock market has gone many years without a red total return year several times. Some notable stretches. 2009-2017. 1991-1999. 1982-1989. 1947-1952. So just because we've had three years of strong gains doesn't mean the bull market has to end here and come crashing down.\n4. The trailing P/E of the S&amp;P 500 is being obfuscated by a few highly weighted stocks with abnormal growth rates. Namely Nvidia, which has a 42x trailing P/E but a 22.5x forward P/E. Historically, the largest stocks in the market usually grew at 3-4% per year.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't good reasons to be bearish. I'm not saying that 2026 is going to be a great year. I'm not even saying that you shouldn't reduce risk or that going to cash won't be the right move in hindsight. I'm just trying to provide some balance to the current uneasy feeling many of us have. Earnings growth has been strong, AI could really improve GDP over the next 5-10 years, margins have been steadily increasing for a long time, and interest rates are coming down.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/](https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/)\n\n[https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns)",

      "title": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector",
      "content": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector\n\nA few weeks ago I saw an interesting post here about the [energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pbgprq/energy_stocks_are_still_cheap_and_nobody_seems_to/) sector. The basic idea was straightforward:\n\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data center capacity planned over the next five years, and data centers are extreme power consumers. In the U.S., a large share of power generation still comes from hydrocarbons, especially natural gas. Companies that provide that energy appear to be overlooked.\n\nWhat that post didn’t get into was a deeper dive into the energy companies themselves — specifically, which ones might actually offer attractive opportunities today.\n\nSo I decided to do that. I used a tool I built that ingests SEC filings for each company and supplements them with industry data from:\n\n* American Petroleum Institute\n* U.S. Energy Information Administration\n* American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers\n* Society of Petroleum Engineers\n* Journal of Petroleum Technology\n* World Oil\n* Oil and Gas Journal\n* Hydrocarbon Processing\n\nI produced 10+ reports across different energy companies. After going through all of them, the companies that stood out to me were:\n\n* [Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/BjArBLK0WHRj) – this was the most interesting to me given that it generated \\~$8.1B of TTM free cash flow in 2024 on a \\~$73B market cap (a mid-teens FCF yield if sustained), while the stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months (+0.9%). It trades at \\~7x EV/EBITDA and \\~12x TTM EPS, despite controlling \\~20.1B boe of long-life 2P oil sands reserves and producing \\~1.36M boe/d. The valuation appears to reflect market skepticism around long-duration durability and Canadian policy risk more than near-term cash generation.\n* [Matador Resources (MTDR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/eXS9JPBjEbOK) – MTDR stood out because balance-sheet stress is not evident in the current numbers: net debt sits below \\~1x EBITDA, production continues to grow in the Delaware Basin, and the company owns majority-interest, largely fee-based midstream assets (San Mateo / Pronto) that support cash-flow stability. Despite this, the stock trades around \\~3x EV/EBITDA, a multiple more commonly associated with higher leverage or structurally challenged E&amp;Ps.\n* [Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/YDjQ0bF0lQjM) – In contrast to the commodity-exposed producers, EPD’s appeal is the consistency of its cash generation: operating cash flow has stayed above \\~$7.5B annually since 2021, distribution coverage has run \\~1.6–1.7x, and the partnership retained \\~$3.24B in 2024 after distributions. Units trade around \\~7.5x EV/EBITDA despite this level of cash-flow stability and balance-sheet strength.\n\nI’m also sharing the reports for the other companies I analyzed in case anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [CHEVRON CORP (CVX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/dPtgVsyaOVZt)\n* [ANTERO RESOURCES Corp (AR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/IDhlgnNAdAUB)\n* [AEMETIS, INC (AMTX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/qWCT1bsvIyDj)\n* [NextDecade Corp (NEXT)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/JJZlaAD3JrFK)\n* [AMEREN CORP (AEE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/bz6cvzIIw5KP)\n* [SM Energy Co (SM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/2rQK36fGNwaD)\n* [Crescent Energy Co (CRGY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/DDSGWbDUlote)\n* [EXXON MOBIL CORP (XOM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/p9Lzg0rb1qKZ)\n* [OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP (OXY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/8ZSEPD2k7oDk)\n* [Vital Energy, Inc. (VTLE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/sYfs8N4YJHVR)\n* [WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. (WMB)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/z2j2kNtxUEXR)\n\nCusious to hear which energy stocks others here are following. Any interesting ones I missed?",

Between the ups and downs of the AI hype cycle, the volatility in crypto, and the broader market swings, I’ve had to adjust my strategy more than once.\n\nIf I had to pick one lesson that stood out, it would be this: I really underestimated the importance of cash management and balanced allocation. There were times I was too aggressive or too concentrated, and it hurt. Looking back, I wish I had focused more on building a portfolio that is steady over the long term but flexible enough to adapt when needed.\n\nCurious to hear from others.

      "content": "A Survey of writings on the AI bubble\n\nThere's been a lot of diverging view points on whether we're in an AI bubble (even this week there was some drama with Oracle and Blue Owl). \n\nI wanted to [share my on thoughts](https://eastwind.substack.com/p/power-overwhelming) &amp; learnings from reading a lot of things on the internet:\n\n* My own takeaways from looking at a bunch of data, which I wrote in my [blog](https://eastwind.substack.com/p/power-overwhelming).\n* Scour the internet for other popular writings that the capture the current \"zeitgeist\". \n\nMy takeaways (from looking at tech companies, VC funding , data center depreciation vs. traditional data centers) are the following:\n\n* We're fine from a fundamentals perspective, at least for the first half of 2026 (AI revenues are growing, models are improving, categories like coding are delivering ROI)\n* If there's a crash, it will be due to sentiment, or if OpenAI / Anthropic miss their revenue projections\n* There are concerns around quality of revenues + ROI for specific industries. We see this both at public companies like Salesforce (with Agentforce) as well as startups.\n* Specific categories of SaaS will not be disrupted by AI in the medium term &amp; SaaS overall is pretty beaten down so those companies will rerate. Some software infra companies give indirect exposure to AI startups (e.g. OpenAI spends a ton on Datadog) \n* There might be a big revenue hole once current capex comes online in 2027/2028. But right now we're generating tokens from the capex from 2021-2024, and relative to capex from those years we're ok\n* AI SaaS revenues + OpenAI / Anthropic revenue growth can't justify capex. Big Tech's internal workloads (e.g. Meta / Google using AI for better ad targeting) matter way more (e.g. better ad targeting, Google serving inference workloads from AI overviews, etc.)\n* Current depreciation schedules (6 years for GPUs) don't make sense at all\n\n  \nAnd some learnings from my readings (some links) don't have notes because as they didn't provide things that were net new information):\n\n[*Can the AI Boom Pay for Itself?*](https://www.thetimes.blog/p/can-the-ai-boom-pay-for-itself)\n\n* If tokens generated increase \\~9-12% monthly (for inference), then we're on track to meet capex. The author does think we're in a phase of overbuild, however.\n\n  \n[*Sam Altman’s Dirty DRAM Deal*](https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/sam-altman-s-dirty-dram-deal) \n\n* The current memory price spike is due to two simultaneous deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for 40% of the world's DRAM supply.

I've got my 401k and an emergency fund set, so now I'm looking to open a brokerage account for some growth oriented investing. I know trying to time the market is a fool's game, so I'm more interested in finding companies I believe in for the next few years.\n\nAll the hype seems to be about AI and semiconductors right now, and the prices reflect that. It feels a bit frothy. I'm trying to look past the current trends and think about what might be a good buy for 2026 and beyond. I keep seeing lists for the \"best growth stocks 2026\" but they all just seem to list the same mega cap tech companies.\n\nI'm not afraid of some risk, but I also don't want to just chase what's already shot up. I'm interested in sectors that might be overlooked now but have solid long term potential.\n\nHow do you even begin to research a company for a 3-5 year time horizon instead of just quarterly earnings?  \nAre there sectors you think are undervalued right now that could be strong contenders for the best growth stocks 2026?  \nHow much does current Fed policy and interest rates play into your long term stock picks?\n\nI'm not looking for specific tickers, more like a framework for how to think about this. If anyone has resources or a strategy they use for finding longer-term growth opportunities, I'd really appreciate it.",

Recent inflation data has given tech stocks some breathing room, while Micron Technology’s strong earnings report added fuel to the rebound. Still, concerns remain about China’s aggressive push into AI infrastructure and semiconductors, which could challenge Nvidia’s long term positioning.\n\n* **Market Rebound**: The Nasdaq has bounced back thanks to favorable inflation numbers, creating a more positive environment for Nvidia and other tech names.\n* **Micron’s Impact**: Micron jumped 9.3% after earnings, which could help boost confidence across the sector, including Nvidia.\n* **China’s AI Push**: Heavy investment from China in AI and chip technology is a looming risk that Nvidia can’t ignore.\n\nOverall, Nvidia is benefiting from short term tailwinds but still faces big structural challenges. Curious how others here are positioning, do you see the rebound as sustainable, or just another temporary lift before competition and macro pressures weigh in again?",

Well, the stock was beaten down this year for 2 reasons: AI fear and some execution risk on M&amp;A. To me, neither of these things are real disrupters for the business. On top of that valuation is close to April level. While I won’t say it’s cheap, the valuation is certainly starting to make sense here.\n\nAnother thing I want to mention is the AI bubble. When people start realize that the current LLMs can’t reach AGI and hyper scalers won’t get their capex money back, the music will stop.

Investors cheered the news as it could encourage the Fed to lower rates. Retailers are seeing consumers trade down to cheaper products.\nWhat does it mean for investors?

      "content": "MU Blowout up over 15% Premarket Is This a Bullish Signal for Tech?\n\nMicron just posted a blowout Q1 FY2026 with results across the board beating expectations. Revenue came in at 13.64 billion dollars up 57 percent year over year and 21 percent quarter over quarter well above the 12.92 billion consensus. Profitability improved sharply with GAAP gross margin rising to 56 percent up 17.6 points year over year and 11.3 points sequentially beating the 51 percent estimate. GAAP net income reached 5.24 billion dollars up 180 percent year over year and 64 percent quarter over quarter again well ahead of expectations. The core driver was explosive AI driven memory demand. HBM led the upside with capacity already sold out and management significantly raising its outlook for the future HBM market showing demand is far stronger than previously expected. At the same time traditional DRAM and NAND also benefited from AI spillover demand and tight supply leading to both volume and price increases and pushing overall margins to new highs. An aggressive next quarter guide further reinforced confidence that the memory industry is entering a new upcycle. Overall the report confirms that AI is lifting not just high end memory but the entire storage stack though with strong growth and elevated valuations options setups look less attractive for buyers right now.  \nAt this point should I continue holding add more or take profits really curious to hear what everyone thinks!",

Deadlines start slipping. A team that used to be fast suddenly moves slower.  \nBudgets stretch further than expected. Meetings multiply without producing decisions. Leaders start sensing friction but theyre not sure where it’s coming from. Is it workload imbalance?  A manager overwhelmed? A team operating without clarity? Resources being allocated the wrong way? Or something deeper, like burnout creeping through an entire department? The truth is inefficiency rarely announces itself. It builds quietly, hidden inside tools, systems, and processes that no one has time to examine. By the time the symptoms are loud enough for executives to notice, the problem has already become expensive. HR is expected to diagnose these issues yet theyre asked to do it without the one thing that would make it possible: connected, clear data. You cant fix what you cant see and most inefficiencies stay invisible far longer than they should and HR AI solutions are needed!!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Time Horizon:** Day | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-18 11:02:02  \n**Overall Sentiment:** **Neutral-to-Bearish with High Retail Skepticism**\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT**\nThe sentiment is fractured. **Institutional data and news flow suggest cautious neutrality** (stable inflation, Fed funds at 3.64%, VIX at a moderate 17.62). However, **retail sentiment (Reddit) is distinctly bearish and skeptical**, marked by themes of disillusionment (\"exit liquidity\"), suspicion of official data (CPI skepticism), and meme-stock nostalgia (GME references). This divergence indicates a lack of broad bullish conviction and potential vulnerability to negative catalysts.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES**\n*   **Political & Macroeconomic Policy Scrutiny:** Heavy focus on Trump-era policies (tariffs, job data) and their perceived economic impact. The release of **December CPI at 2.7%** is a dominant, contested theme.\n*   **Disillusionment with \"Hype\" Sectors:** Retail traders express cynicism toward former darlings (\"AI Infrastructure\" as a bag-holder narrative, ASML dip on China news). Profit-taking is celebrated as a pragmatic win (\"paid cash for a Honda\").\n*   **Speculative & Meme-Stock Mania Persists:** Despite disillusionment, activity continues around names like **DJT** (soaring on merger news) and cryptic GME/AMC references (\"MOASS will start at 2\"), indicating remaining pockets of high-risk retail speculation.\n*   **Geopolitical & Regulatory Crosscurrents:** News highlights EU-Mercosur trade hopes, China's reported EUV tech breakthrough (threatening ASML), and Chevron navigating Venezuela tensions.\n*   **Corporate & Credit Developments:** Focus on M&A (Warner Bros., Trump Media/TAE), credit ratings (Renault upgrade), and regulatory actions (Citi penalty shed).\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Primary Catalyst:** **December CPI print of 2.7%.** This is the key macro data point. Its credibility is being challenged in retail circles, which could amplify market volatility if institutional algorithms react to the print while retail traders fade the move.\n*   **Secondary Catalysts:**\n    *   **ASML (-6%):** Signal of growing competitive risk in the core semiconductor equipment space.\n    *   **DJT (+25%):** Signal of intense, politically-linked speculative fervor capable of ignoring traditional fundamentals.\n    *   **FMP Movers (VIVK +42%, UGRO +28%):** Signal of extreme micro-cap volatility, but low volume suggests these are not broad market signals.\n    *   **Fed Funds Rate (3.64%) & 10Y Yield (4.15%):** Signal a still-restrictive policy stance. The \"munis set to reap cash as Fed cuts\" news suggests the market is anticipating the *next* phase of the cycle.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Risks:**\n    1.  **Sentiment Decoupling:** Deep retail distrust of official data (CPI) creates a fragile floor. Any macro disappointment could trigger an outsized sell-off as retail joins institutional selling.\n    2.  **Political Volatility:** Market-moving headlines tied to Trump policies and the DJT merger increase uncertainty.\n    3.  **Tech Leadership Erosion:** The ASML news is a canary in the coal mine for the AI/infrastructure trade, a key market pillar.\n    4.  **Liquidity Illusion:** Extreme moves in low-volume tickers (FMP snapshot) represent trap-like conditions for uninformed traders.\n*   **Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Stable Macro Plays:** The confirmed CPI trend (if believed) and anticipated Fed cuts favor **rate-sensitive sectors** (Utilities, REITs) and **muni bonds** as per news.\n    2.  **Contrarian Quality:** Market skepticism can create entry points in **high-quality, cash-flow positive tech** if sold off with the \"hype\" names.\n    3.  **M&A Arbitrage:** News flow indicates ongoing corporate action (Media, Autos, Energy).\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n*   **SECTOR: Semiconductors (Equipment) - CAUTION.** The ASML news is a structural headwind. Monitor **LRCX, KLAC** for contagion. Avoid catching the falling knife in pure-play EUV narratives.\n*   **SYMBOL: DJT - EXTREME RISK.** The +25% move on merger news is a classic \"sell the news\" retail frenzy setup. This is a volatility source, not an investment thesis. Consider **puts or put spreads** for sophisticated traders only; others should avoid entirely.\n*   **SECTOR: Municipal Bonds - WATCH.** The RSS news explicitly highlights this as a beneficiary of the coming rate-cut cycle (**MUB**). Provides defensive yield with tax advantages.\n*   **SYMBOL: ASML - WAIT FOR BASING.** The 6% dip on significant news needs time to settle. Do not buy before a clear consolidation pattern forms. Next support level is key.\n*   **MACRO: FADE THE INITIAL CPI REACTION.** Given the high retail skepticism, the first market move post-CPI may be reversed. Be prepared for whipsaw. **Trading VIX options or /ES futures** around the data release requires heightened risk management.\n*   **THEMATIC: Shift from \"AI Hype\" to \"AI Profitability\".** The top Reddit post is a warning. Focus on companies with tangible AI revenue and margins (**MSFT, GOOGL, META**) over pure infrastructure speculations.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is in a contentious holding pattern. Institutional calm is being tested by retail cynicism and political noise. The dominant play is **defensive positioning** around rate-sensitive assets while avoiding the lingering meme-stock and AI hype traps. The CPI data credibility will set the tone for the session.",

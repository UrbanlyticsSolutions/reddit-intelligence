      "content": "\"There is no way that the U.S. oil production data is correct.\" Anonymous comment\n\nBeen wondering about all the data points the administration has been putting out, but the oil production numbers have been a little strange.\n\nOil production is increasing every month, except May, in 2025. Strange is that I couldn't find another year that happened. Probably because it's nearly impossible to have increasing production month after month after month. (Please correct me if I'm wrong)\n\nHere is the data:  \n[https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=M](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=M)\n\nDallas Fed Energy Survey Dec 17, 2025 where the quote was taken.

      "content": "NBIS is a steal at this price, change my mind\n\nI’m currently averaged at $96 on Nebius and I definitely wish I’d waited a bit longer to build my position. At these levels though, I genuinely think the stock is massively undervalued. A lot of the recent decline feels driven by bad sentiment driven by bad sentiment and a broader sell off after Oracle’s earnings. At current pricing, this looks like one of the biggest steals in the market to me.\n\nHere's why:   \n\n\n**- AI compute is structurally undersupplied.** \n\nThis is not a short cycle issue. Training and inference demand keeps growing faster than GPU supply, power availability and data center capacity. Companies that can actually deliver large scale GPU clusters with power and networking are the bottleneck.\n\nNebius sits right in that bottleneck.\n\n  \n**- Hyperscaler validation matters more than narratives**  \nMicrosoft signed up to $19.4B in multi year GPU capacity. Meta followed with another $3B. These are not pilot projects or optional experiments. This is mission critical infrastructure.\n\nIf Microsoft and Meta are willing to rely on Nebius for AI compute, the tech works and the execution bar has already been cleared at a very high level.\n\n  \n\\- **Extreme growth**   \nQ3 revenue was up 355% YoY.  \nARR today is roughly $550M and guided to ramp to $7–9B by the end of 2026 as contracted capacity comes online.  \nAI operations are already EBITDA positive with margins around 20%.\n\n**- Capex is not the problem people think it is**  \nYes, capex is massive. That is the business. But Nebius is sitting on roughly $5B in cash and raised convertibles at extremely low interest rates. Capital markets are clearly comfortable financing this growth because the demand is locked in by secured deals.\n\n  \n**- This is the most important one, everyone keeps forgetting the extra assets they own besides the cloud business**   \nMost people talk about Nebius as if it’s just an AI cloud provider. That’s missing a big part of the picture.\n\nOn top of the cloud business, Nebius still owns several assets that have real value and are basically being priced at a huge discount or in my opinion even close to zero (!!) by the market right now.\n\nAvride ($2-3B valuation) is now partnered with Uber. Avride is working with Uber on delivery robots, which is a massive market on its own.\n\nThen there’s TripleTen ($300-500M)growing fast in a high margin digital space\n\nOn top of that, Nebius still has stakes in things like AI data annotation and database tech through Toloka and ClickHouse ($2B) . These aren’t random side projects, they sit right in the AI value chain and have raised at serious private valuations in the past.\n\nIf you do even conservative sum of the parts math, you’re talking about several billion in value outside of the core cloud business. Right now, the market seems to be valuing Nebius almost purely as “AI cloud plus execution risk” and ignoring everything else. \n\nIf Nebius actually hits the target of  $7–9B ARR in 2026, you’re looking at a forward revenue multiple of roughly 2.4x for the core cloud business. While others easily have a multiple of 5-10. \n\n**- The real risks**  \nI don't want to turn a blind eye to the risk, because ofc there are:   \n\\- Data center build timelines slipping  \n\\- Customer concentration  \n\\- Share dilution over time\n\nAll real. But they are execution risks, not demand risks. Chance of execution is (in my opinion) the highest at Nebius compared to others, because of their former Yandex experience.   \n  \nThis all seems to good to be true to me, so please convince me if i'm missing something here. Even a base case should provide a valuation of roughly 120-150$ according to my research. \n\n\n\n",

      "content": "NBIS; An Opportunity To Be A Generational Bag Holder\n\nHere is a company whose core business revolves around purchasing costly depreciating GPUs and renting their output out to hyper scalers such as Microsoft at a loss.\n\nTheir subsidiaries are arguably nothing but money-sinks (Clickhouse, AVride, etc.) and are outclassed by numerous competitors such as Snowflake, Starship Technologies, etc.\n\nWhile Revenue has grown 300%+ year over year, expenses have grown at a faster rate and the company is essentially burning through money.\n\n1. Secure a contract at a loss -&gt; \n\n2. Use contract to get a loan/funding -&gt; \n\n3. Build out infrastructure/acquire GPUs -&gt; \n\n4. Repeat -&gt; \n\n5. Hope to eventually become a competing AWS alternative for AI cloud solutions.\n\nThe problem: \n\nToday, the overwhelming majority of NBIS's revenue comes from hyper scalers looking to offload demand. NBIS is providing them the compute at a loss. \n\nAt anytime a hyperscaler(s) can choose to no longer use NBIS when unfavorable, which will completely cripple the company's finances.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are currently investing extremely heavily into their own data centers to keep up with demand, so the chance of Nebius acquiring customers that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, can't provide supply to in the future is low.\n\nThere is also huge uncertainty regarding NBIS's future cashflows, demand, and financial solvency. Shareholders may unknowingly be diluted to raise funds, a forced buy-out can happen, etc.\n\nOverall, NBIS is a great opportunity to become a generational bag holder. Simply ignore the financials and choose to invest off of vibes, chasing hype, etc., and you may potentially find yourself holding a bag for years to come.",

I locked up about $10,000 worth of BTC and borrowed $5,500 cash. The app called that “55% LTV”. All it means is: loan divided by collateral value.\n\nThe terms said a warning would hit around 70% and an auto-sell could happen around 80%. I read it, nodded, and moved on. Big mistake. Because the math changes fast when price drops.\n\nThat night BTC slid hard. My $10,000 collateral became roughly $7,800 in a few hours. My loan was still $5,500, so my LTV jumped to about 70%+. I got a message: “margin call, 24 hours to cure.” Cure means add more collateral or repay part of the loan.\n\nI tried adding $1,000 more BTC from another wallet. Network fees were spiking and my transfer sat pending. I tried repaying $500 instead, but my bank transfer wouldn’t clear instantly. Support chat replied like “high volume, expect delays.” The timer didn’t care.\n\nBy morning the app showed “partial liquidation executed.” They sold a chunk of my BTC to push the ratio back down, then charged an execution fee on what they sold. I wasn’t wiped out, but I did sell at the worst moment without choosing to.\n\nIf you ever use these loans, assume a 30% drop can happen any random day. Borrow lower than you think, keep extra collateral ready, and make sure you can move money fast.",

Stocks have been pretty weak in Q4. High beta stocks have gotten demolished. Buffet's cash pile is at an ATH. Aswath Damodaran is suggesting investors buy collectibles to diversify. The S&amp;P has returned over 20% two years in a row followed by \\~15% so far in '25. There's concerns over Oracle's debt, OpenAI making commitments they can't keep, circular deals, many people even believe we're in a full on bubble.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to point out some data that may make you rethink selling out of your stocks and going to cash.\n\n1. There have only been four years since 1938 where the S&amp;P 500 total return was -18% or worse. 1974, 2002, 2008, and 2022. So 4/87 years. Yes, 18% is somewhat cherry picked and of course cumulative peak to trough drawdowns have been much worse than 18%. But if you bought on the close of the last day of the trading year, you only lost 18% or more over the next 12 months 4.6% of the time.\n2. The S&amp;P 500 PEG ratio is currently 1.2 which is roughly about average since 1995. It was above 1.6 in 2016. Above 1.5 in 2004. And above 1.4 for much of the 2010s. It even got to 2.0 in 2023 but quickly reversed.\n3. The stock market has gone many years without a red total return year several times. Some notable stretches. 2009-2017. 1991-1999. 1982-1989. 1947-1952. So just because we've had three years of strong gains doesn't mean the bull market has to end here and come crashing down.\n4. The trailing P/E of the S&amp;P 500 is being obfuscated by a few highly weighted stocks with abnormal growth rates. Namely Nvidia, which has a 42x trailing P/E but a 22.5x forward P/E. Historically, the largest stocks in the market usually grew at 3-4% per year.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't good reasons to be bearish. I'm not saying that 2026 is going to be a great year. I'm not even saying that you shouldn't reduce risk or that going to cash won't be the right move in hindsight. I'm just trying to provide some balance to the current uneasy feeling many of us have. Earnings growth has been strong, AI could really improve GDP over the next 5-10 years, margins have been steadily increasing for a long time, and interest rates are coming down.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/](https://yardeni.com/charts/stock-market-p-e-ratios/)\n\n[https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns)",

      "content": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector\n\nA few weeks ago I saw an interesting post here about the [energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pbgprq/energy_stocks_are_still_cheap_and_nobody_seems_to/) sector. The basic idea was straightforward:\n\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data center capacity planned over the next five years, and data centers are extreme power consumers. In the U.S., a large share of power generation still comes from hydrocarbons, especially natural gas. Companies that provide that energy appear to be overlooked.\n\nWhat that post didn’t get into was a deeper dive into the energy companies themselves — specifically, which ones might actually offer attractive opportunities today.\n\nSo I decided to do that. I used a tool I built that ingests SEC filings for each company and supplements them with industry data from:\n\n* American Petroleum Institute\n* U.S. Energy Information Administration\n* American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers\n* Society of Petroleum Engineers\n* Journal of Petroleum Technology\n* World Oil\n* Oil and Gas Journal\n* Hydrocarbon Processing\n\nI produced 10+ reports across different energy companies. After going through all of them, the companies that stood out to me were:\n\n* [Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/BjArBLK0WHRj) – this was the most interesting to me given that it generated \\~$8.1B of TTM free cash flow in 2024 on a \\~$73B market cap (a mid-teens FCF yield if sustained), while the stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months (+0.9%). It trades at \\~7x EV/EBITDA and \\~12x TTM EPS, despite controlling \\~20.1B boe of long-life 2P oil sands reserves and producing \\~1.36M boe/d. The valuation appears to reflect market skepticism around long-duration durability and Canadian policy risk more than near-term cash generation.\n* [Matador Resources (MTDR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/eXS9JPBjEbOK) – MTDR stood out because balance-sheet stress is not evident in the current numbers: net debt sits below \\~1x EBITDA, production continues to grow in the Delaware Basin, and the company owns majority-interest, largely fee-based midstream assets (San Mateo / Pronto) that support cash-flow stability. Despite this, the stock trades around \\~3x EV/EBITDA, a multiple more commonly associated with higher leverage or structurally challenged E&amp;Ps.\n* [Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/YDjQ0bF0lQjM) – In contrast to the commodity-exposed producers, EPD’s appeal is the consistency of its cash generation: operating cash flow has stayed above \\~$7.5B annually since 2021, distribution coverage has run \\~1.6–1.7x, and the partnership retained \\~$3.24B in 2024 after distributions. Units trade around \\~7.5x EV/EBITDA despite this level of cash-flow stability and balance-sheet strength.\n\nI’m also sharing the reports for the other companies I analyzed in case anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [CHEVRON CORP (CVX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/dPtgVsyaOVZt)\n* [ANTERO RESOURCES Corp (AR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/IDhlgnNAdAUB)\n* [AEMETIS, INC (AMTX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/qWCT1bsvIyDj)\n* [NextDecade Corp (NEXT)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/JJZlaAD3JrFK)\n* [AMEREN CORP (AEE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/bz6cvzIIw5KP)\n* [SM Energy Co (SM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/2rQK36fGNwaD)\n* [Crescent Energy Co (CRGY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/DDSGWbDUlote)\n* [EXXON MOBIL CORP (XOM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/p9Lzg0rb1qKZ)\n* [OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP (OXY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/8ZSEPD2k7oDk)\n* [Vital Energy, Inc. (VTLE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/sYfs8N4YJHVR)\n* [WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. (WMB)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/z2j2kNtxUEXR)\n\nCusious to hear which energy stocks others here are following. Any interesting ones I missed?",

Historically, BOJ tightening has caused short-term dips before things stabilize  sometimes even setting up a decent bottom once the event risk clears. That said, with expectations this high, the bigger question might be how much of this move is already priced in. A hike could still cause turbulence, but a surprise hold would be even more disruptive given current positioning.\nCurious to see how others are positioning into this hedge, stay flat, or trade the post-decision reaction?",

Historically, the Sahm indicator has been used as a confirmation tool for \"recession\" (I use quotes because I feel the term has become more and more ambiguous in recent years) and is a measure of how unemployment is trending.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the Sahm indicator--It looks at the unemployment moving average.  Fundamentally, it takes a look at the lowest 3-month moving average over a 12-month period (currently about \\~4.2%) and compares it to the most recent 3-month moving average.  Essentially, if the current 3-month moving average is .50% (50 bps) higher than the 3-month moving average low, it produces a confirmation signal of \"recession\" with no historical false positives. \n\nThe current moving average of unemployment is \\~4.43% which puts us north of 20 bps toward the signal.  If the January 9th print is anything higher than 4.7%, there will be real concerns about the state of the economy (will put unemployment moving average at about \\~40 bps above  the moving average low).  As of today's (12/17) price action, it looks like the market is pricing in the possibility of an accelerating unemployment trend that could continue in January's print.  The Fed recently cut rates which may help reduce firing rates as cost saving measures, but January's unemployment print will be critical in understanding where the economy is at and likely where the stock market will go next.  \n\nTL;DR--If unemployment print on 1/9/26 &gt;4.7%, risk off.  If less than, likely a neutral to risk on shift.  ",

      "content": "What’s the best lesson you have learned in 2025?\n\nAs we near the end of 2025, I’ve been thinking a lot about how this year has played out for me as an investor. Between the ups and downs of the AI hype cycle, the volatility in crypto, and the broader market swings, I’ve had to adjust my strategy more than once.\n\nIf I had to pick one lesson that stood out, it would be this: I really underestimated the importance of cash management and balanced allocation. There were times I was too aggressive or too concentrated, and it hurt. Looking back, I wish I had focused more on building a portfolio that is steady over the long term but flexible enough to adapt when needed.\n\nCurious to hear from others. What was the most important lesson you learned this year, whether it’s about strategy, mindset, or a specific event that changed your thinking?",

      "content": "Nvidia in the Middle of Market Trends &amp; AI Competition\n\nNvidia’s price action continues to be shaped by broader market forces and the intense competition in the AI sector. Recent inflation data has given tech stocks some breathing room, while Micron Technology’s strong earnings report added fuel to the rebound. Still, concerns remain about China’s aggressive push into AI infrastructure and semiconductors, which could challenge Nvidia’s long term positioning.\n\n* **Market Rebound**: The Nasdaq has bounced back thanks to favorable inflation numbers, creating a more positive environment for Nvidia and other tech names.\n* **Micron’s Impact**: Micron jumped 9.3% after earnings, which could help boost confidence across the sector, including Nvidia.\n* **China’s AI Push**: Heavy investment from China in AI and chip technology is a looming risk that Nvidia can’t ignore.\n\nOverall, Nvidia is benefiting from short term tailwinds but still faces big structural challenges. Curious how others here are positioning, do you see the rebound as sustainable, or just another temporary lift before competition and macro pressures weigh in again?",

I told him with that kind of money go to a big brokerage and invest in an easy 3 fund portfolio. He has 10-15 years before retirement and this is what’s going to set him up because honestly he doesn’t have much else. Any criticism is appreciated.

Deadlines start slipping. A team that used to be fast suddenly moves slower.  \nBudgets stretch further than expected. Meetings multiply without producing decisions. Leaders start sensing friction but theyre not sure where it’s coming from. Is it workload imbalance?  A manager overwhelmed? A team operating without clarity? Resources being allocated the wrong way? Or something deeper, like burnout creeping through an entire department? The truth is inefficiency rarely announces itself. It builds quietly, hidden inside tools, systems, and processes that no one has time to examine. By the time the symptoms are loud enough for executives to notice, the problem has already become expensive. HR is expected to diagnose these issues yet theyre asked to do it without the one thing that would make it possible: connected, clear data. You cant fix what you cant see and most inefficiencies stay invisible far longer than they should and HR AI solutions are needed!!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-18 09:31:49 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **BEARISH WITH SPECULATIVE POCKETS**\nThe overall sentiment is bearish, driven by retail disillusionment, geopolitical tensions, and sector-specific pressures. Reddit sentiment shows high frustration (\"exit liquidity,\" \"rate my bags\"), economic pessimism (\"not as wealthy as we thought\"), and skepticism around recent rallies (DJT, NVDA). The VIX at 17.62 and elevated 10Y yield (4.15%) signal persistent uncertainty. However, speculative fervor remains in select names (DJT, UGRO), indicating a bifurcated market where retail is chasing narratives despite broader caution.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES\n- **AI & Tech Disillusionment:** Reddit posts highlight pain in \"AI Infrastructure\" trades and NVDA's >20% drop. ASML's 6% dip on China EUV news underscores tech supply chain anxieties.\n- **Political & Macroeconomic Anxiety:** Trump-era policies (tariffs, job growth data) and December CPI (2.7%) are focal points. The \"household net worth\" discussion reflects concerns over economic resilience.\n- **Speculative Mania & Meme Dynamics:** DJT's merger news (+25%), \"gamma nightmare\" discussions, and the bizarre UK GME ticker volume spike show retail's continued engagement with high-risk, narrative-driven plays.\n- **Credit & Distress Signals:** RSS news highlights distress in real estate (Blackstone CMBS deal), corporate bankruptcy (coding-for-preschoolers), and sovereign stress (Cuba devaluation, Ukraine debt swap).\n- **Sector Rotation & Valuation Reset:** NVDA's decline and Reddit's \"price re-evaluation\" debate suggest a broader tech/ growth reckoning. Meanwhile, commodities (copper in Argentina) and energy (Texas grid) gain attention.\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n- **Immediate Catalyst:** December CPI at 2.7% – above the Fed's target, potentially delaying rate cuts and supporting the elevated 10Y yield.\n- **Sector Signal:** ASML drop on China EUV news is a critical semiconductor supply chain risk signal – monitor SMH, SOXX for contagion.\n- **Retail Behavior Signal:** DJT's 25% surge post-merger news shows retail's sensitivity to Trump-related catalysts. However, the \"exit liquidity\" post warns of potential traps.\n- **Volatility Signal:** VIX at 17.62 with high Reddit engagement in options/ gamma discussions (Burry post) suggests elevated near-term volatility, particularly in single names.\n- **Credit Signal:** Blackstone using CMBS debt for a REIT buyout indicates continued stress and financial engineering in commercial real estate.\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n**Primary Risks:**\n1. **Tech Wreck Acceleration:** NVDA downtrend could deepen if ASML news triggers broader semiconductor sell-off. Retail is already nursing losses.\n2. **Political Policy Uncertainty:** Trump tariff/manufacturing debates and job data critiques may increase regulatory and trade policy volatility.\n3. **Credit Contagion:** Distress in CRE (CMBS deals) and corporate bankruptcies could spill over if rates remain higher for longer.\n4. **Retail Capitulation:** High frustration on Reddit could turn into broad selling if losses mount, exacerbating downside moves.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n1. **Contrarian Tech Entry:** Selective buying in oversold, high-quality tech names (e.g., NVDA at -20%) if inflation fears ease.\n2. **Commodities & Infrastructure:** Copper mining interest (Argentina) and Texas grid focus suggest energy/industrial plays.\n3. **Speculative M&A Plays:** Merger activity (DJT/TAE) may create short-term volatility opportunities in related SPACs or small-caps.\n4. **Defensive Rotations:** Healthcare (cancer drug pricing article) and utilities may benefit if risk-off deepens.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n- **NVDA:** Monitor $170 support. A break below could trigger further retail capitulation. However, long-term AI demand remains intact – consider scaling in below $165 if volume confirms support.\n- **SEMICONDUCTOR SECTOR (SOXX/SMH):** Heightened geopolitical risk from ASML/China news. Reduce exposure until clarity emerges on EUV technology diffusion.\n- **DJT:** Extreme volatility expected post-merger. Retail enthusiasm is high, but fundamental valuation is disconnected. **Trade only with tight stops** – this is a sentiment play, not investment.\n- **REAL ESTATE (XLRE/IYR):** Avoid CRE-heavy REITs. Blackstone's CMBS deal signals ongoing stress. Prefer residential over commercial.\n- **ENERGY/COMMODITIES (XLE/COPX):** Copper demand narrative strengthening (Argentina mining). Consider positions on pullbacks as infrastructure/energy transition plays.\n- **TREASURIES (TLT):** 10Y yield at 4.15% may peak if CPI stabilizes. Long-duration bonds could offer hedge if growth fears resurface.\n- **VOLATILITY (VIX):** VIX ~18 suggests options premiums elevated. Consider selling premium in indices (SPX) rather than single names where gamma risk is high (per Reddit discussion).\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is in a corrective phase with retail sentiment souring, but speculative impulses remain alive. Prioritize capital preservation—reduce exposure to high-momentum, retail-favorite names. Focus on sectors with tangible catalysts (commodities, select infrastructure) and await clearer signals on inflation and tech valuation support. The day's key watch is whether NVDA and semis stabilize post-ASML news.",

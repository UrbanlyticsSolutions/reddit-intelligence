      "content": "Commerce to open up exports of Nvidia H200 chips to China\n\nSeeking a compromise over controlling exports to China, the US Department of Commerce will soon allow the export of powerful Nvidia GPUs that are roughly 18 months behind its most advanced offerings, according to a person with knowledge of the plan.\n\nThe move, which would send Nvidia H200s to China, seeks to find a middle ground between those who oppose exports of any advanced AI chips and those who worry that restrictions will merely hand the market to Chinese competitors. It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government, which has blocked imports of less powerful chips, such as Nvidia’s H20.\n\nThe move, which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, could bolster Nvidia’s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide.\n\nThe US enacted strict export restrictions under the Biden Administration in an effort to prevent China from catching up on AI. But some in the White House believe those restrictions have more or less failed, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n    \n[Source](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/08/2025/commerce-to-open-up-exports-of-nvidia-h200-chips-to-china)",

      "content": "Carvana $CVNA is Highly Fraudulent\n\nCredentials:  14 year automotive veteran.  15 year options trader\n\nBullet Points:\n\n1) Carvana’s profit margins are too good to be true.  The best companies in the industry don’t come close to their 19% gross profit margins.  \n\n2) The CEO of Carvana (Ernest Garcia III) Also owns a privately owned auto business named Drivetime.  Drivetime is a dumpster fire.\n\n3) Ernest Garcia III has been funneling his unwanted Carvana inventory to Drivetime to prop up Carvana’s earnings.  Drivetime overpays Carvana for this inventory and then takes the loss on their own balance sheets.\n\n4) Over the last few months Ernest Garcia III has been selling tens of millions of dollars of stock to keep Drivetime afloat\n\n5) Carvana has issued roughly 15.3 million shares over the last year.  At average $330 price this comes to roughly 5 Billion USD.  None of this reflects on the company’s financial report.  \n\nThesis:\n\nBased on CVNA October 2025 earnings report the company’s equity attributed to shareholders increased by 1B usd.\n\nIn the same period the company issued ~15.3 million shares worth over 5B usd.  None of this issuance reflects on the company’s balance sheets.  Healthy companies issue dividends and buy back stock.  Carvana has no dividend and has issued billions in stock solely to their core insiders.\n\nDrivetime (a company owned by Carvana’s CEO) has the worst inventory I have ever seen.  Thousands and thousands of cars that are absolutely overpriced garbage.  Some of the cars they have been sitting on for over 6 months.  \n\nIn October and September of 2025 Ernest Garcia III has sold roughly 82 million dollars of carvana stock.  \n\nI am not a private investigator, financial pro, or accountant, but to me the evidence is compelling that carvana’s results are being directly propped by DRIVETIME and once the Garcias have enriched themselves the real results will emerge.\n\nI plan to open short positions against CVNA in the next few weeks after they fully transition to the SP 500",

Waymo is one of the largest positions in Tiger’s 2024 fund.\n\nWaymo declined to comment.\n\nThis year, Waymo has also announced a slew of expansions, including its debut on freeways in three cities, and autonomous driving in cities including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando.\n\nThe latest milestone is also another sign that Waymo is continuing to push ahead of aspiring self-driving competitor Tesla, which has run limited pilots in Austin and operates a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area.\n\nTesla vehicles include human drivers or safety supervisors on board and are not driverless like Waymo’s fleet vehicles.\n\nAccording to Tesla’s latest earnings call, executives said the company hit a quarter of a million miles with its fleet in Austin, and more than one million in the Bay Area. In July, Waymo announced 100 million total fully autonomous miles.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/waymo-paid-rides-robotaxi-tesla.html)",

It’s another reminder of how tight controls around AI and high-end chips have become, and how aggressively enforcement is picking up as demand keeps rising.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/us-attorneys-office-southern-district-of-texas-prosecutors-nvidia-chips-h200-h100-smuggle-china.html?__source=androidappshare",

      "content": "Michael Saylor just pitched countries on creating Bitcoin backed digital banking systems and the concept is pretty wild.\n\nSpeaking in Abu Dhabi, Saylor laid out a vision where countries could use Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit to offer regulated bank accounts that give way higher returns than traditional deposits. He pointed out that banks in Japan, Europe and Switzerland barely pay any interest while US money market funds are around 4%. People are basically disgusted with their bank accounts which is why corporate bonds exist.\n\nHis proposal involves structuring accounts with about 80% digital credit instruments, 20% regular currency, and an extra 10% buffer to reduce volatility. The digital credit layer would be backed by Bitcoin reserves with about 5 to 1 overcollateralization. Basically using Bitcoin as the ultimate collateral layer.\n\nSaylor thinks a country that implements this could attract $20 to $50 trillion in deposits and become the digital banking capital of the world. Thats not a small claim.\n\nHowever theres obvious skepticism here. Bitcoin is down 28% from its recent highs and dropped 9% over the past year. The volatility makes people question how you can build stable high yield products on top of it. One former bond trader called Saylors moves folly and said hiking rates to maintain a peg wont work when people want their money back during a panic.\n\nStrategy already has a product called STRC that works somewhat like this - its grown to $2.9 billion but faces doubts about whether it can handle a real liquidity crunch.\n\nThe idea is innovative but feels like it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating long term to actually work. What happens during extended bear markets?",

My allocation is 70/20/10 which feels right but the mental clarity from simplifying was honestly the best part, I don't spend hours reading earnings or arguing online anymore, I check everything with blossom now and my returns have been totally fine, just buying more shares monthly and ignoring the noise, nothing crazy but steady…\n\nIf you're on the fence about going full bogle I'd say just do it, the peace of mind is worth more than chasing extra returns",

With the missing October data, and the compromised November data, I actually think they might opt to hold rates steady until they have a more complete data set in January. From their point of view there is no harm in waiting; one month won't make a big difference in the long term. Looking at the most recent reports, the data doesnt seem to support the notion that inflation is coming down or that joblessness is much worse than it was earlier this year--look at the charts. I'm sure a lot of you want to tell me that the job market is trash, and I agree, but it's not in the data. And we definitely can't be certain that tariffs are gone for good. I'm preparing for a bloodbath this Wednesday, maybe even the beginning of the AI crash. ",

But the key question is **what happens next year**.\n\nPowell's term ends in May next year, and Trump has already picked his successor (likely Kevin Hassett, White House National Economic Council Director, super dovish). Market rumors say it could be announced before Christmas.\n\n**Two variables for next year:**\n\n1. **New chair will be more dovish** \\- Hassett wrote \"Dow 36,000,\" advocates for quick rate cuts and tax cuts, absolutely bullish for stocks. 1-2 cuts next year should be solid.\n2. **Tariff situation is settled** \\- Trump's tariff policy is basically done negotiating, deals are signed, exemptions granted. Although some furniture and lumber tariffs will increase next year, overall it won't spike like it did in April. Supreme Court is reviewing tariff legality, but even if overturned, Trump has other legal tools available, minimal impact.\n\n**What about tomorrow?**\n\nFutures are already up 0.4%, likely opening with a small gain of 0.2-0.5%. Real direction depends on Powell's 2:30 PM press conference. If he's optimistic about next year, Nasdaq pushes to 23,700-24,000. If he's still worried about inflation, might pullback to 23,300.\n\n**What about 2026?**\n\nWall Street predicts Nasdaq up 15-25% next year, targeting 27,000-30,000. Logic: AI continues burning cash, tech earnings grow 15-20%, new chair more dovish, tariffs won't get worse.\n\nBottom line - next year's hand is actually pretty good. Powell's out, someone who loves cutting rates comes in; tariff war's over, no more chaos. Nasdaq's up 22% this year, another run next year isn't impossible.",

The decision partially rolls back restrictions that had previously barred shipments of Nvidia’s A100, H100, and H200-class GPUs to Chinese customers over national security concerns.\n\nUnder the revised rules, Nvidia may resume sales of the H200 so long as exported configurations fall within newly defined performance limits and comply with enhanced government monitoring. The adjustment follows weeks of uncertainty, during which Nvidia executives repeatedly emphasized that final export approval would ultimately come from President Trump.\n\nChina represents 20 to 25% of Nvidia’s data-center revenue. Restoring access even partially could meaningfully lift 2026 sales guidance.",

Private Chinese companies are still reliant on Nvidia, but with the right government policies, that will be over by 2030. \n\nAnd India needs startup and big tech funding to develop its own AI chip design and manufacturing industry.

      "content": "The 5 \"North Star\" Principles I Return to When the Market Gets Manic (Graham &amp; Munger Refresher)\n\nI’ve been reading a lot of complex DCF models and technical debates on the sub recently. While the math is obviously critical, I think it’s easy to get lost in the weeds and forget the philosophical bedrock that makes Value Investing work in the first place.\n\nI recently went back through Graham’s *The Intelligent Investor* and *Charlie Munger’s Almanack* to organize my own thinking. I wanted to share the 5 core principles that I treat as non-negotiable, especially when the market feels irrational.\n\n**1. Price vs. Value (The Behavioral Trap)** *\"Price is what you pay; value is what you get.\"* This is the hardest psychological hurdle. We are biologically wired to view a rising price as validation and a falling price as failure. Value investing requires decoupling these two. I try to view \"Mr. Market\" as a tool to be used, not a guide to be followed. If he offers a discount, I buy. If he’s manic, I ignore him.\n\n**2. The Margin of Safety (The Engineering)** Graham’s \"Rule #1.\" It’s basically engineering redundancy for your portfolio. If you buy a dollar for 50 cents, you can be wrong about the growth rate, management, or macro headwinds and *still* not lose money. It’s not just about maximizing upside; it’s about pre-calculating the downside so you survive the mistake.\n\n**3. Quality over \"Cigar Butts\" (The Pivot)** Early Graham focused on \"cigar butts\" (dying companies that were cheap). Buffett and Munger evolved this. It is far better to buy a *wonderful* company at a fair price than a *fair* company at a wonderful price. Time is the friend of the wonderful business and the enemy of the mediocre one.\n\n**4. The \"Latticework\" (The Edge)** Investing isn't just finance. Munger’s concept of the \"Latticework of Mental Models\" suggests that if you only know accounting, you’ll fail. You need to understand psychology (biases), history (cycles), and probability. The best investors are \"learning machines\" first and analysts second.\n\n**5. Temperament &gt; Intellect** You can have a 160 IQ and go broke if you can't control your emotions. The ability to do nothing for 2 years while holding cash, or to buy when the headlines are apocalyptic, is a temperament skill, not an IQ skill.\n\n**My Takeaway:** Whenever I make a mistake, it’s usually because I violated #2 (paid too much) or #5 (got impatient).\n\n*I wrote a longer breakdown with some visual aids and the full quote collection here if you want to bookmark it:*[https://humblepics.com/what-is-value-investing/](https://humblepics.com/what-is-value-investing/)",

The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report.\n\nBeijing has been [pushing back](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cautions-tech-firms-over-nvidia-h20-ai-chip-purchases-sources-say-2025-08-12/) against domestic firms' use of U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions.\n\nEarlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development.\n\nThe export of the [H200 chips](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-open-up-exports-nvidia-h200-chips-china-semafor-reports-2025-12-08/) will be permitted with a 25% fee levied on such sales, Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to export other chip lines such as Blackwell or Rubin.\n\nShares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading.

Although it’s the default “VOO and chill” which is a little boring, it’s relatively reliable and stable as a compounder and captures the overall strength of the US economy.\n\n- QQQM as the turbocharger for growth. Yes, VOO already has tech, but I see QQQM as a deliberate overweight into the sector which beats the broad market over the long run. I’m still on the boat that the tech sector will continue to thrive exponentially.\n\n- VXUS to capture everything non-US related. Europe, Japan, emerging markets, developed Asia. When the dollar weakens, when US valuations get too hot, when global cycles differ, VXUS is my ballast and the global hedge so I can ensure that I’m not betting my entire future on just one country.",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Time Horizon:** Day | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-09 09:01:54 | **Primary Audience:** Retail Traders\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Cautiously Bullish with Elevated Event Risk**\nThe sentiment is a **split between structural bullishness and tactical caution**. Retail forums (Reddit) show high engagement with speculative, momentum-driven themes (AI chips, earnings, large options bets like \"30K SPY YOLO\"), indicating strong risk appetite. However, this is juxtaposed against macro headwinds: a stalling Treasury rally, a \"hawkish\" Fed cut narrative, and high single-stock volatility (e.g., NVDA down pre-market despite positive news). The VIX at 16.66 suggests moderate but not complacent fear. Overall, the market is being driven by bullish narratives (AI, earnings) but is highly sensitive to incoming data and geopolitical events.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES: AI/Geopolitics, Macro Data Anxiety, and Retail Speculation**\n*   **AI & Semiconductor Geopolitics:** Dominant theme. Multiple Reddit posts and news items confirm the U.S. (under Trump administration) will allow Nvidia H200 chip sales to China. This is a major catalyst for the semiconductor sector, directly impacting NVDA and related supply chains.\n*   **Macro Data & Fed Policy Anxiety:** Underlying tension from delayed economic reports (October PPI delayed until mid-January creates data opacity), a stalling Treasury rally, and focus on a potentially \"hawkish\" Fed rate cut. The disconnect between a \"dragging\" economy and a \"thriving\" stock market is a key point of discussion and concern.\n*   **Retail Speculation & Momentum Trading:** Reddit sentiment is focused on high-beta, story-driven moves: earnings plays (\"Happy Earnings Day\"), extreme options positioning (SPY, NFLX OTM calls), and short-squeeze/crowd-driven narratives (e.g., Carvana fraud allegation posts). This indicates a chase for momentum, not value.\n*   **Sector-Specific M&A & Competition:** Paramount's hostile bid for Warner Bros. highlights media consolidation. Waymo's lead over Tesla in robotaxis underscores the competitive intensity in autonomous vehicles.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (NVDA):** The U.S. government's greenlight for H200 sales to China is a **clear positive fundamental catalyst** for Nvidia, potentially opening a significant revenue stream. The pre-market dip (-0.52%) may represent \"sell the news\" profit-taking or broader market drag, creating a potential entry point.\n*   **Macro Signal:** The 10Y Yield at 4.14% with a stalling rally suggests bond markets are digesting stronger-than-expected data (JOLTS). This is a headwind for long-duration growth stocks.\n*   **Volatility Signal:** The combination of large, suspicious order book activity noted by retail traders, extreme OTM options bets, and crypto volatility (Bitcoin at $94k) points to elevated intraday volatility and potential for sharp, news-driven moves.\n*   **Contrarian Sentiment Signal:** Overwhelmingly bullish Wall Street analyst ratings (e.g., on NVDA, MSFT, INTU, CMG) amid macroeconomic crosscurrents can sometimes be a contrarian indicator of crowded positioning.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Geopolitical Whiplash:** Policy on tech exports to China could reverse quickly, hitting the AI trade.\n    2.  **Macro Data Surprise:** The next inflation or jobs print in this opaque environment could violently re-price Fed expectations.\n    3.  **Retail Crowding Risk:** Concentrated retail enthusiasm in names like NVDA, SPY options, and meme-adjacent stocks (CVNA) increases vulnerability to rapid deleveraging.\n    4.  **Liquidity Events:** The Reddit post describing a large market order \"chewing through the order book\" highlights the risk of thin liquidity amplifying price moves.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Policy-Driven Clarity:** The formal approval of chip sales reduces a major overhang for semiconductors, providing a fundamental tailwind.\n    2.  **Volatility Harvesting:** Elevated VIX and retail option activity create opportunities for volatility sellers (e.g., covered call writing) on strong underlying holdings.\n    3.  **Mispricing from Noise:** Stocks with strong fundamentals (e.g., CMG down 14.5% post-earnings but with positive analyst outlook) may be oversold due to short-term sentiment.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n*   **NVDA:** **Monitor for consolidation post-news.** The China sales news is a long-term positive, but the stock is a retail and institutional darling. Wait for the initial volatility (pre-market dip, possible opening surge) to settle. A hold above $180 could signal strength for a renewed push. **Action:** Watch for a defined intraday support level as an entry point for a tactical long.\n*   **SEMICONDUCTOR SECTOR (SOXX/SMH):** **Beneficiary of geopolitical thaw.** NVDA's news lifts the entire sector sentiment. Look for strength in AI-adjacent chipmakers and equipment suppliers. **Action:** Consider sector ETFs for diversified exposure to the theme with lower single-stock risk.\n*   **SPY/QQQ:** **Heightened near-term volatility expected.** The \"30K SPY YOLO\" post exemplifies extreme bullish bets that can exacerbate moves. With macro data as a pivot point, expect choppy price action. **Action:** Avoid chasing breakouts; prefer buying near key support levels (e.g., 20-day MA) if the bullish trend is to hold.\n*   **COMMUNICATION SERVICES SECTOR (XLC):** **In play due to M&A.** Paramount's hostile bid for Warner Bros. could trigger further speculation and valuation re-ratings across traditional media. **Action:** Watch for unusual volume in names like PARA, WBD, and DIS.\n*   **TREASURIES (TLT):** **Rally stalling is a warning.** The failure of bonds to rally further suggests the market's rate cut optimism may be peaking. This is a headwind for tech valuations. **Action:** A break above 4.20% on the 10Y Yield could trigger a risk-off move; monitor closely.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is in a bullish trend fueled by AI and speculation, but trading on fragile macro ice. **Tactical patience is key.** Prioritize entries in strong thematic sectors (Semis) on pullbacks, reduce leverage due to event risk, and use sector rotation (out of long-duration growth if yields rise) as a risk management tool. The retail sentiment is a useful gauge of momentum but should not be conflated with institutional direction.",

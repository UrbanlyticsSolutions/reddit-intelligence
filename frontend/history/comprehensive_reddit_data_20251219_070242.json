Trust me…I know. I’m in an absolute low right now and I pray that one day I can pullback. I managed to get a temporary extension for what is owed but I lost everything because I got lucky with liberation day, I made a lot because it and had plans to start my life with my girlfriend, she doesn’t know yet but each day I don’t tell her is killing me.\nI sold the house I grew up in, a burden I never wanted to deal with and I explicitly said I don’t want to worry about what is owed, I was naive enough to do my taxes on my own which came around liberation day and I genuinely did not expect to end the year like this.\nI made plans on paying my taxes several times and let it slip by and here I am.\nI wish a golden trade came my way and gave me a valuable life lesson and scare but I made my grave and I hope my girlfriend will forgive me.\nI have adhd and struggle with it daily, I chased the dopamine and panicked, fumbled hard.\nIf anything I wish to say please don’t do what I did, do not chase the dream because you’ll be left with a nightmare.\nIt’s so bad…",

This block carried a base reward of about 3.125 BTC (following the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced mining subsidies), plus additional transaction fees that pushed the total payout slightly higher. The block's hash is 0000000000000000000039a7a8d1b6b3b4f1e8e4f868c4, and it processed over 2,800 transactions, highlighting the ongoing activity on the Bitcoin network despite its immense scale.\n\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/928351\n\nI wouldn’t recommend you trying this though, as you probably will have better odds buying lottery tickets.

      "content": "Oracle +5% after hours after TikTok signs binding US joint venture with Oracle taking 15% stake\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-says-signed-agreements-create-222642566.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-says-signed-agreements-create-222642566.html)\n\n&gt;TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew told employees that the social media company and its parent, ByteDance Ltd., signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture majority-owned by American investors\n\n&gt;In an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Chew said he was “pleased to share some great news” and said agreements with Oracle Corp., Silver Lake and MGX have been signed. Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22, 2026.\n\n&gt;“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” Chew said in the memo. Meanwhile, “TikTok global’s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing,” he wrote.\n\n&gt;The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September, which was pending approval from China. Chew’s memo does not mention China’s opinion on the transaction. It says 50% of the investors will be new, with Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment company, retaining 15% each; 30.1% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance.\n\n&gt;After more than a year of negotiations, Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance’s popular video app to a consortium of investors. If finalized, the deal would remove a persistent issue in Beijing-Washington relations and signal progress in broader talks. But it would also deprive China’s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon.\n\n&gt;ByteDance’s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok’s business. Under the the deal proposed by Washington, ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity, which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle, TikTok’s cloud partner.\n\n&gt;Trump’s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know?: QuickTake\n\n&gt;The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement, which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration. US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app’s recommendation algorithm.\n\n&gt;Under the law, the initial deadline for the sell-or-ban rule was this past January, but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office, most recently pushing it into January 2026.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bes8jzkrv18g1.png?width=1587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f406b925304f2c0ce50176783172b3016adb28fc\n\n",

      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

Buffett will be particularly missed at a time when many of the most successful people in the business community seem single-mindedly focused on making money, without reflecting much on the way they make it or what they will do with it. Just because you *can* doesn’t mean you *should*.\n\nMakes me a little sad that I got interested in this topic this year, at the tail of end Buffett's career. \n\n",

Just sit it out like Buffett or just put some money in the S&amp;P 500 and that's it.

If you don't know why a stock went up, you won't understand why it goes down...\n\nYou should know when a company is undervalued and when it's overpriced.\n\n**\"I bought a stock one month ago, it went down 5%, should I sell?\"**\n\nIf you truly did your DD and you are a value investor, you just sit it out. You have time; you bought to hold it for years.

If you are too lazy to read one book, you probably don't have the discipline to be a value investor.\n\nBonus: If this book is to \"difficult\" (no shame in that, I started very very slow) start with Peter Lynch + Youtube New Money.\n\nMost of you have the knowledge but some here either dont understand Valueinvesting or simply dont have the dispcpline and try to chase quick returns.\n\nEverything I do isnt based on my \"opinion\" or community posts its based on the tools of people who 100x smarter than me like Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham etc.\n\nWith these tools I try to find \"gaps\" in the marked and thats it.

      "content": "Will memory chip prices continue to skyrocket?\n\nMicron's earnings report showed strong demand for memory chips, easing investor concerns about a potential slowdown in data center construction. Micron Technology's adjusted revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $13.64 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations of $12.95 billion; adjusted net profit was $5.482 billion, compared to $3.469 billion in the same period last year. The company projected second-quarter revenue of $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion, significantly higher than the market expectation of $14.3 billion. Morgan Stanley analysts stated that, besides Nvidia, this might be the largest upward revision of revenue and net profit guidance in the history of the US semiconductor industry.\n\nKey data at a glance: Not only did the first-quarter performance exceed expectations, but the second-quarter revenue guidance was even higher, at $18.7 billion ± $400 million, a full $4 billion more than the market estimate of $14.38 billion! This data is not isolated, but rather a \"charge signal\" for the full recovery of the memory chip industry.",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

The new entity is expected to be majority US owned, with ByteDance keeping about 19.9 percent, and the deal is targeted to close by Jan 22 2026. (related news source if you’re interested: [Oracle-Led Group Takes 45% Stake in TikTok US](https://www.moneyai-app.com/share/session?shareUuid=b0ce56e8-ac96-4ced-a4fd-e73f82cbf11f))\n\nA lot of people read this as ByteDance being forced into survival mode. From a capital markets lens, it looks more like they’re taking an asset that’s been trading at a long running geopolitical discount and repackaging it into something that can be priced, financed, and eventually exited.\n\nThat’s the real point of the structure. Wall Street can live with compliance costs, but it struggles to underwrite a political black box. A US led entity with clearer governance and auditability is basically a cleaner wrapper around the same cash flow engine.\n\nI’m not saying this means “IPO soon.” But it does make an IPO or partial listing feel less like a meme and more like a plausible option down the road, mainly because it creates a straightforward liquidity story for big US investors.\n\nThe part that matters most to me is TikTok Shop. Ads set the floor, commerce sets the ceiling. If discovery to purchase inside the feed keeps scaling, TikTok starts looking less like a social app and more like transaction infrastructure. If that holds under the new structure, the valuation conversation changes fast.",

On that same day, 8 executives/directors executed stock sales under 10b5-1 plans.

But i feel lost between the 2 but the thing I love the 2.

I mean the companies that produce the power, not the companies that buy it and sell it to consumers. \n\nFrom where I sit, Texas is the number one destination for these huge power hungry AI data centers.  There are by my calculations exactly 0 new power plants being built, for the most part the power companies are focusing on making them more efficient or expanding some but shovels breaking ground on new is zero and its been zero since Biden passed the build back act.  \n\nIn my opinion there is a pretty clear reasons why none have gotten off the ground, they have long build times and there are countless ways that they can be derailed.  \n\nThe reason for Texas is that they have a unique power grid that allows for open market bidding on power and its not meaningfully connected to the eastern or western part of the US grid.    \n\nIf my thesis is correct that data centers will require a huge amount of power, can be put up very quickly, have vast resources to bid on the open market and no new power sources are coming online for at least 10 years, the premium that the producers of power in Texas will be able to charge is going to go up significantly.

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 07:01:55 | **Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT  \n**Overall Sentiment: Bearish with Elevated Volatility Risk**  \n\n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Overwhelmingly skeptical and anxious. Key themes include distrust of inflation data (CPI skepticism), concerns over national debt and interest costs, and warnings about speculative losses (e.g., options trading). The focus on \"witching day\" (quadruple witching) and high-profile short squeezes (GME) suggests retail traders are bracing for volatility.  \n- **Macro Data:** The 10Y Treasury yield at 4.16% and Fed Funds Rate at 3.64% indicate a restrictive monetary environment. VIX at 16.87 is elevated but not panicked, suggesting cautious hedging.  \n- **News Flow:** Fed’s Williams signaling no urgency for further cuts reinforces higher-for-longer rates, a headwind for equity valuations.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES  \n**A. Inflation & Economic Data Distrust**  \n- Reddit threads heavily question CPI accuracy (e.g., \"0 CPI data for October and November,\" \"wacky number\" on housing inflation). This reflects retail skepticism toward official narratives, which could fuel volatility if data releases surprise.  \n- RSS news lacks direct inflation updates, but Fed commentary (Williams) suggests policymakers are data-dependent yet cautious.  \n\n**B. Global Monetary Policy Shifts**  \n- **Japan’s Yield Breakout:** 10-year JGB yield >2% (first time in 15 years) and BOJ hike to 30-year highs are major macro events. This could unwind yen carry trades, impacting global liquidity (mentioned in Reddit: \"GME & Japan Carry Trade\").  \n- **Fed Hold:** Higher-for-longer U.S. rates contrast with BOJ tightening—watch for USD/JPY volatility and spillovers into U.S. equities.  \n\n**C. Speculative Retail Narratives**  \n- Meme stock resurgence (GME references, Google price error noted) and cautionary tales of options losses highlight frothy retail behavior.  \n- Trump Media merger with TAE Technologies ($6B deal) may attract speculative retail interest in political-linked assets.  \n\n**D. Corporate & Geopolitical Developments**  \n- Invesco’s QQQ vote unlocking $180M suggests ETF structural changes affecting liquidity.  \n- EU bonds face pressure from Ukraine funding needs—sovereign debt concerns align with Reddit’s national debt anxiety ($38T debt, $1T+ interest).  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Catalysts (Today):**  \n- **Quadruple Witching (Options/Futures Expiry):** Cited in Reddit as \"record witching day\"—expect elevated volume and potential pinning effects on major indices.  \n- **BOJ Aftermath:** Yen volatility may pressure U.S. tech/growth stocks (carry trade unwinding).  \n\n**Medium-Term Signals:**  \n- **Yield Curve:** 10Y Treasury at 4.16% with ERP at 4.33% implies equity risk premium is thin, limiting upside.  \n- **Gold (GLD) at $398.78:** Slight haven demand but not surging—suggests markets are not pricing immediate crisis.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Liquidity Shock:** BOJ tightening could reduce global dollar liquidity, impacting leveraged positions.  \n2. **Volatility Spike:** Quad witching + retail speculation (GME, options) may cause erratic moves in single names.  \n3. **Data Credibility Crisis:** If inflation distrust spreads, bond markets could react violently to CPI revisions or alternative data.  \n4. **Debt Sustainability:** Rising interest payments ($1T+) may trigger fiscal fears, pressuring long-duration assets.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Carry Trade Adjustments:** Short JPY/long USD trades may reverse—favor USD-sensitive exporters or hedge JPY exposure.  \n2. **Defensive Positioning:** High yields make cash and short-term Treasuries attractive vs. equities.  \n3. **Meme Stock Volatility:** Options sellers could capitalize on elevated premium in names like GME, but risk is extreme.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**For Traders/Investors:**  \n\n**SECTOR: Financials** – Monitor Japanese banks (e.g., MFG, SMFG) for BOJ policy benefits, and U.S. regional banks for credit risk from higher rates.  \n\n**SYMBOL: GLD** – Hedge against potential currency volatility from BOJ/Fed divergence. Gold may see bids if equity volatility (VIX) jumps post-witching.  \n\n**SYMBOL: TLT** – Long-duration Treasuries are risky with yields elevated, but any flight-to-quality move (e.g., equity sell-off) could bring a rally. Prefer short-duration (SHY) for carry.  \n\n**SECTOR: Technology** – Under pressure from high rates and potential carry trade unwinding (strong JPY hurts USD earnings). Watch AMZN (AWS focus per Cramer) for relative strength.  \n\n**SYMBOL: VIX** – Consider short-term volatility hedges via VIX calls or put spreads on indices ahead of witching.  \n\n**MACRO: USD/JPY** – Key pair to watch; break below 148 could signal accelerated carry unwind, risk-off.  \n\n**RISK WARNING:** Retail sentiment is pessimistic and speculative—avoid chasing meme stocks (GME, DJT) without strict risk management. Options activity may be distorted by witching.  \n\n---\n\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market faces a triple threat of structural volatility (witching), global monetary shift (BOJ), and retail distrust. Prioritize capital preservation—reduce leverage, raise cash, and hedge equity exposure. Today’session could see sharp moves post-expiry.",

This block carried a base reward of about 3.125 BTC (following the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced mining subsidies), plus additional transaction fees that pushed the total payout slightly higher. The block's hash is 0000000000000000000039a7a8d1b6b3b4f1e8e4f868c4, and it processed over 2,800 transactions, highlighting the ongoing activity on the Bitcoin network despite its immense scale.\n\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/928351\n\nI wouldn’t recommend you trying this though, as you probably will have better odds buying lottery tickets.

      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

      "content": "r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Fundamentals Friday Dec 19, 2025\n\nThis is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Friday.",

Just sit it out like Buffett or just put some money in the S&amp;P 500 and that's it. Save it for \"good times\" which are the opposite for \"normal\" investors.\n\n**\"This stock went up 700%, is this stock good?\"**\n\nIf the only value you see is that the stock went up by 700%+, that's not value investing...\n\n**\"Should I buy Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, XYZ?\"**\n\nWhat about you do your own DD and stay in your area of competence. If you don't know why a stock went up, you won't understand why it goes down...\n\nYou should know when a company is undervalued and when it's overpriced.\n\n**\"I bought a stock one month ago, it went down 5%, should I sell?\"**\n\nIf you truly did your DD and you are a value investor, you just sit it out. You have time; you bought to hold it for years. I have stocks in my portfolio for over 10 years...\n\nI could go on and on and on, like trimming your portfolio every month, just looking at the numbers and not understanding the company, etc., etc., etc.!\n\n  \n**\"This stock dipped 30% everybody all in\"** \n\nI heard this story 100s times, I always ask, what makes you believe that it will go up again ? If you dont have a good answer dont buy! \n\n  \n\n\nIt's not that difficult to be a value investor. All you need is:\n\n**Benjamin Graham - The Intelligent Investor**\n\nMake sure you truly understand it, I needed time to understand it fully! If you are too lazy to read one book, you probably don't have the discipline to be a value investor.\n\nBonus: If this book is to \"difficult\" (no shame in that, I started very very slow) start with Peter Lynch + Youtube New Money.\n\nMost of you have the knowledge but some here either dont understand Valueinvesting or simply dont have the dispcpline and try to chase quick returns.\n\nEverything I do isnt based on my \"opinion\" or community posts its based on the tools of people who 100x smarter than me like Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham etc.\n\nWith these tools I try to find \"gaps\" in the marked and thats it. Sometimes it takes years sometimes only month. I have time!",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

Broadcom’s debt is far larger than AMD's. \nAMD's goal is to gain market share from Nvidia. But Google's TPU performance shows that big techs can rely on their own custom chips rather than buying from Nvidia or AMD.  Therefore, I am guessing big techs will use more and more of their own custom chips in future. Considering those facts, would it be a good idea to buy Broadcom by selling all of AMD's shares? ",

Only a break above 276 signals an upward trend.\n* GOOG: Faces resistance at 305.

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions.

PADD 3 refiners (Valero, Chevron, Phillips 66) are historically short on heavy sour crude due to Mexican export cuts\n2. Refiners will draw down commercial inventories\n3. If the coup takes longer than 30 days, inventories hit critical lows\n4. Bid up Canadian WCS to panic levels\n5. CNQ targets 1.59 – 1.65 million BOE/d in 2026, with \\~25% as heavy sour crude. WCS goes up, profit margins for CNQ goes up\n6. CNQ goes up sharply\n7. Sell for profit\n8. Short CNQ immediately on reversion to mean\n\nRight now the entire O&amp;G narrative is on the supply glut, this present a contrarian buying opportunity for this thesis. The longer the Venezeula war goes, the better the thesis plays out. \n\n",

      "content": "are there any power ETF's that only hold Texas based power production companies?\n\nIs there an ETF that holds only Texas power production companies and companies who produce power for sale in Texas?  I mean the companies that produce the power, not the companies that buy it and sell it to consumers. \n\nFrom where I sit, Texas is the number one destination for these huge power hungry AI data centers.  There are by my calculations exactly 0 new power plants being built, for the most part the power companies are focusing on making them more efficient or expanding some but shovels breaking ground on new is zero and its been zero since Biden passed the build back act.  \n\nIn my opinion there is a pretty clear reasons why none have gotten off the ground, they have long build times and there are countless ways that they can be derailed.  \n\nThe reason for Texas is that they have a unique power grid that allows for open market bidding on power and its not meaningfully connected to the eastern or western part of the US grid.    \n\nIf my thesis is correct that data centers will require a huge amount of power, can be put up very quickly, have vast resources to bid on the open market and no new power sources are coming online for at least 10 years, the premium that the producers of power in Texas will be able to charge is going to go up significantly.

On that same day, 8 executives/directors executed stock sales under 10b5-1 plans. I understand the same-day execution is plausibly explained by price-based triggers or limit orders.\n\nHowever, I saw that the 8 plans that executed on December 8 were initiated in two clusters:\n\n* 3 plans on March 13, 2025\n* 5 plans on August 6, 2025\n\nI pulled Form 4 data for Wave from 2024–2025 to look closer at this pattern and wrote up the details here [https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/](https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/)\n\nMy question:  \nI'm relatively new to this. Is this kind of clustered 10b5-1 adoption and execution fairly typical in biotech or other industries? Is this easily explained by compensation cycles/normal planning, or is this something you’d flag as worth a second look? \n\nI haven't yet benchmarked against a larger sample of biotech companies, that's on my list if this is indeed notable.",

      "content": "Is enhanced direct indexing the right choice for me?\n\nBackground: over a decade ago I invested a sizeable chunk of my savings into a big tech company that has done well over the intervening years. Now I find myself in a position where a large percentage of my portfolio is in this single security and I'm looking to diversify.\n\nI have been told that enhanced direct indexing is a good option for unwinding a concentrated position. I'm a novice here but if I understand it correctly, for a non-trivial fee, a management firm will use my concentrated position as leverage to buy long and short positions and use tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains, effectively diversifying while deferring the large taxable event.\n\nAre there big inherent risks I'm not aware of? Are there other options I should consider? I recognize there's a real risk by having nearly half of my portfolio in a single security but I don't want to make a mistake and take an even greater risk trying to unwind it. \n\nThanks!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORT**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 10:02:00 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: BEARISH WITH HIGH RETAIL ANXIETY**\nThe aggregate sentiment is **Bearish**, driven by a confluence of macro fears and skeptical retail narratives. The VIX at 16.87 suggests elevated, but not panicked, near-term volatility expectations. Retail sentiment (Reddit) is dominated by themes of distrust in official data, warnings of market events (\"Witching Day\"), and bearish macro catalysts. This contrasts with more neutral-to-positive corporate news flow in the RSS feed (e.g., FedEx, small company surprise). The disconnect indicates a **fragile market psyche** where positive micro stories are being overshadowed by macro and structural concerns.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES**\n*   **Macro Policy & Debt Anxiety:** Dominant theme. Reddit highlights surging Japanese yields, record U.S. debt servicing costs, and skepticism of inflation data (\"Zero Housing Inflation\" claim). RSS news is quieter here, making this a potent retail-driven narrative.\n*   **Major Central Bank Shifts:** **Bank of Japan** is a critical catalyst. Its rate hike to a 30-year high and the 10Y JGB yield crossing 2% is a seismic shift in global liquidity dynamics, potentially pulling capital from risk assets.\n*   **Distrust in Institutions & Data:** Reddit threads show extreme skepticism toward media, government data, and financial leadership (e.g., Apple buybacks, \"FUD\" warnings). This sentiment can amplify sell-offs and fuel volatility.\n*   **Event-Driven Volatility Warnings:** \"Record Witching Day\" points to significant options/futures expiry, a known technical catalyst for intraday volatility, especially in a nervous market.\n*   **Idiosyncratic Moves & Speculation:** Mentions of GME price anomalies, crypto mining windfalls, and Michael Burry's activity point to persistent speculative pockets, but these are noise against the macro backdrop.\n\n### **3. CRITICAL MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Primary Catalyst (Today):** **Quadruple Witching Expiry.** Expect elevated volume and potential for sharp, directionless swings, especially in the final hour. This technical event interacts with a nervous fundamental backdrop.\n*   **Primary Catalyst (Near-Term):** **Global Yield Re-pricing.** The **Bank of Japan's decisive shift** (RSS #11, Reddit #1, #11) is the most significant fundamental signal. It challenges the \"Japan as perpetual low-yield funding source\" paradigm, a potential headwind for global equities.\n*   **Contrarian Signal:** The \"Big Surprise From Small Companies\" (RSS #2) suggests underlying economic resilience not reflected in retail sentiment. This divergence could present opportunities if macro fears ease.\n*   **Sentiment Gauge:** The **VIX (16.87)** is above its long-term average but not at panic levels. A spike above 20 today would confirm witching-related stress is bleeding into broader risk aversion.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Liquidity Drain:** Accelerating BoJ tightening could accelerate the unwind of global carry trades, pressuring leveraged assets and growth stocks.\n    2.  **Volatility Spike:** The combination of witching, yield shocks, and negative retail sentiment creates a tinderbox for a sharp, sentiment-driven selloff.\n    3.  **Data Credibility Crisis:** If the \"zero housing inflation\" critique (Reddit #7) gains mainstream traction, it could destabilize bond markets and Fed policy expectations.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Oversold Quality:** A broad, sentiment-driven dip may create entry points in companies demonstrating fundamental strength (e.g., themes from RSS #1, #2).\n    2.  **Volatility Harvesting:** Elevated VIX and event-driven volatility support strategies like covered calls or defined-risk spreads for income.\n    3.  **Sector Rotation:** A \"higher-for-longer\" global yield environment favors **financials** (banks) and continues to pressure long-duration assets.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**WATCH:**\n*   **/ES (S&P 500 Futures) & VIX:** Monitor for volume spikes and VIX behavior around the market open, midday, and especially after 3:00 PM ET during witching settlement.\n*   **FXY (Japanese Yen ETF) & TLT (Long-Term Treasury ETF):** Strength in FXY and weakness in TLT would confirm the \"global yield shock\" narrative is driving capital flows.\n*   **Reddit Sentiment on \"Witching\":** If posts shift from warning to claiming manipulation or major losses, it could indicate a capitulation spike is near.\n\n**ACT:**\n*   **SECTOR: Financials (XLF) - CAUTIOUS BULLISH.** Beneficiaries of steeper yield curves (BoJ, higher U.S. 10Y). Focus on large, well-capitalized banks.\n*   **SECTOR: Technology (XLK) - NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS.** The sector is duration-sensitive. Favor companies with strong buybacks, robust FCF, and non-cyclical demand (e.g., themes from Oracle, Micron in RSS #9) over speculative growth.\n*   **SYMBOL: SOXS - HIGH-RISK SENTIMENT GAUGE.** The Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X ETF is down -8.21% pre-market. This could indicate either a short squeeze or underlying semiconductor strength. **Watch for reversal:** If SOXS rallies today amid broad market weakness, it signals a severe risk-off move into tech/growth.\n*   **ACTION: Reduce Leverage & Raise Cash.** The combination of a major technical event (witching) and a fundamental macro shift (BoJ) justifies defensive positioning. Use strength to trim marginal positions.\n*   **ACTION: Avoid Chasing Extreme Movers.** Extreme pre-market gainers like **LAZR (+102%)** and **FOLD (+30%)** are likely low-volume, news-driven squeezes. In this environment, they are high-risk for rapid mean reversion.\n\n---\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market faces a tactical volatility event (witching) layered atop a structural macro shift (BoJ policy). **Retail sentiment is a leading indicator of fear, not direction.** Prioritize capital preservation today. Let the witching volatility settle before reassessing for opportunities in sectors that benefit from the new yield regime. The key post-close question will be whether the BoJ narrative sustains beyond today's mechanical flows.",

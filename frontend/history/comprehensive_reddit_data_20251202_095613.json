Even during Covid couldn't make any gains. Gave up for a year. I recently got promoted at work in October, so I decided to throw in $5k into a Webull account and now I'm here 2 months later.

      "content": "Apple’s artificial intelligence chief is stepping down, company says\n\nApple’s head of artificial intelligence, John Giannandrea, will step down from his position, the company announced on Monday.\n\nThe move is the most visible shakeup in Apple’s artificial intelligence group since the company announced Apple Intelligence, its AI software suite, in 2024.\n\nApple Intelligence, which was intended to put Apple alongside AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, has not been well-reviewed by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026.\n\nGiannandrea will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft. Before that, he worked at Google’s DeepMind, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nSubramanya will be Apple’s vice president of AI, the company said, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple said Giannandrea would remain as an advisor until next spring.\n\nIn a statement, Cook said that Federighi already played a key role in Apple’s AI efforts. Federighi is Apple’s top software executive.\n\n“In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,” Cook said in a statement.\n\nSubramanya will lead teams at Apple working on the company’s foundation models, research, and AI safety, the company said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai.html)",

      "title": "Michael Burry Calls Out Tesla Stating They Are \"Ridiculously Overvalued\"",
      "content": "Michael Burry Calls Out Tesla Stating They Are \"Ridiculously Overvalued\"\n\n“Big Short” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter, calling the electric-vehicle maker “ridiculously overvalued” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern. Burry argued that Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders.\n\nBurry cited Tesla’s SEC filings showing that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market.\n\nHe noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution.\n\nBurry also referenced Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards.\n\nTesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels. Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.",

I see low P/E ratios everywhere but sometimes that doesn’t = undervalued.\n\nWhat are some stocks you have done research into ? I believe TSMC has some growing to do especially since its Q3 was great. Its downsides are macroeconomic and how it’s heavily linked to Nvidia and other companies in the semiconductor web. \n\nCurious to hear your thoughts .. ",

      "content": "Amazon releases an impressive new AI chip and teases a Nvidia-friendly roadmap\n\nAmazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs.\nThe cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at its AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product in on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.\n\nAWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation, according to AWS.\nAWS says the systems are more than four times faster, with four times more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10 times the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. \nPerhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation.  While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.\nIt is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscience way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  \nAWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, Splashmusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. \n\n\nAWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step-up in performance and support Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  \nThis means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon’s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  \nIt’s worth noting, too, that Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), has become the de facto standard that all AI apps support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon’s cloud.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/",

      "content": "Big move from Amazon: new AI chip Trainium3 aims to undercut Nvidia.\n\nAmazon is officially pushing deeper into the AI chip war. Their cloud unit just launched **Trainium3**, a new processor designed to run heavy AI model training at a lower cost and higher efficiency than Nvidia’s GPUs at least according to Amazon.\n\nThe pitch seems clear: companies want cheaper AI compute, and Nvidia’s pricing + demand backlog is still insane. If Amazon can offer decent performance for less, there’s definitely a market for it.\n\nBut there’s a catch.  \nTrainium3 doesn’t have anything close to Nvidia’s software ecosystem. CUDA and the entire Nvidia stack are still massive moats, and they’re the reason companies can deploy models quickly without rewriting everything. Amazon doesn’t have that luxury yet.\n\nIis Nvidia’s dominance still unshakeable because of the ecosystem lock-in or you think Amazon actually becomes a real competitor in AI hardware",

      "content": "A 'seismic' Nvidia shift, AI chip shortages and how it's threatening to hike gadget prices\n\nAnalysts are starting to flag a new concern: the AI boom is beginning to strain global chip supply chains in a way that could eventually push up the cost of consumer electronics — including smartphones. AI data centers require massive numbers of GPUs and supporting components, and companies like Nvidia, AMD, Google, and Microsoft are all drawing from the same pool of suppliers. As demand accelerates, several parts of the supply chain are struggling to keep up. Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu recently described the situation as “undersupply,” pointing to shortages across chip manufacturers, memory suppliers, and storage device makers and said the bottleneck could last two to three years.\n\nConsultants at Bain &amp; Company highlighted two immediate pressure points: **Hard disk drives (HDDs):** Hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft have pushed HDD capacity to the limit. **Solid-state drives (SSDs):** With HDDs running short, big cloud companies are shifting toward SSDs the same components used in consumer electronics. On top of that, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a stacked version of DRAM crucial for Nvidia’s latest AI chips, is also in tight supply. These constraints ripple backward through the semiconductor ecosystem and raise the cost of parts used in everyday devices. As AI infrastructure spending surges, several key components are facing multi-year shortages. That raises the risk of higher prices — or even limited availability — for some consumer tech products if supply doesn’t catch up soon.",

      "content": "Masayoshi Son Regrets Nvidia Exit but Says SoftBank Needed Capital for OpenAI Push\n\nMasayoshi Son opened up on Monday about SoftBank’s decision to sell its entire Nvidia stake and he didn’t sugarcoat how he felt about it. Speaking at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo, Son said he “was crying” as SoftBank offloaded the stock, which brought in roughly $5.83 billion.\nAccording to Son, the sale wasn’t about lack of confidence in Nvidia. Instead, SoftBank needed the capital to fuel massive upcoming AI investments, including larger bets on OpenAI, data-center infrastructure under the Stargate Project, and its chip ambitions via Ampere Computing. Son reiterated that SoftBank is “all in” on AI and hinted that the firm may expand its OpenAI investment depending on future valuations. SoftBank’s focus on AI has already paid off the conglomerate’s Q2 net profit more than doubled, aided by valuation gains tied to OpenAI. Despite growing market concerns about a potential AI bubble, Son dismissed the skepticism, saying those calling it a bubble are “not smart enough.” He predicts that advanced AI systems and AI robotics could eventually generate at least 10% of global GDP, justifying the scale of current investment.For Son, selling Nvidia shares wasn’t a statement about the chip giant it was a sacrifice to fund what he sees as the next wave of global technological transformation.",

The NVDA AI GPUs will fast track the design output, however there would be a design bias (via training data and hardware optimisation) that would result in the custom silicon chips being similar to NVDA GPUs. This is a defensive play to prevent the rise of non-GPU disruptive custom silicon. Also, increases the NVDA CUDA moat.\n\nExciting times ahead!",

CEO Sam Altman reportedly issued a “code red” inside the company after the latest wave of AI model releases from Google and Anthropic, signaling that the competition in the AI world is now everything but calm.What’s changing: OpenAI is pausing or slowing down all side projects think shopping agents, ad-powered chatbots, health-assist tools, and its planned “Pulse” personal assistant to focus all efforts on improving ChatGPT itself: speed, reliability, personalization, and overall performance are being pushed to the top of the to-do list. The move says a lot about where we are in the 2025 AI race. Google’s latest models reportedly outperformed GPT-5 on multiple benchmarks.  Meanwhile, Anthropic is also racing ahead with serious upgrades. If you were holding onto OpenAI because of its “first-mover” lead this memo makes it clear nothing’s guaranteed anymore. The challenge just got very real. Anyone else think this “code red” feels more like a scramble than a strategy? Or is this just how cutthroat the AI race has become now that everyone’s chasing the same trillion-dollar prize?",

At the same time, rate-cut bets keep rising  futures now price in an 86% probability of a 25 bps cut at next week’s FOMC meeting.  \nUncertainty is also building around potential candidates to take over the Fed chair position if Powell isn’t renewed.\n\nEarnings remain light, with Marvell, MongoDB, Vestis, and Credo drawing attention after their latest results.\n\nMeanwhile, tokenized markets continue to move at a very different speed.\n\nWhile traditional markets pause and wait for the Fed, Bitget Stock Futures just surpassed $10 billion in trading volume. Bitget and other plateforme are already running large-scale tokenized stock futures, while the Nasdaq is still waiting on SEC approval before it can offer its own tokenized stock offerings.\n\nI’m starting to think that the Fed’s decision next week might matter less for long-term structure than the shift we’re seeing toward tokenized market rails.  \n\n\nSource: [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-st-futures-muted-as-traders-digest-weak-ism-data-fed-cut-bets-bitcoin-slide-4384983](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-st-futures-muted-as-traders-digest-weak-ism-data-fed-cut-bets-bitcoin-slide-4384983)",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORT**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-02 09:55:26 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: CAUTIOUSLY BEARISH WITH SPECULATIVE POCKETS**\nThe overall sentiment is **bearish-to-neutral**, marked by high caution and defensive posturing from institutions, juxtaposed with aggressive retail speculation in niche assets.\n*   **Macro & Institutional Caution:** Elevated VIX (17.24), high 10Y yield (4.02%), and a significant equity risk premium (4.33%) signal investor demand for compensation against perceived risk. News themes center on economic headwinds (Black Friday spending concerns, affordability as a top political issue) and regulatory/legal battles (tariffs, labor law).\n*   **Retail Speculative Fervor:** Reddit sentiment is dominated by high-risk, high-reward narratives: **GME warrants** (multiple trending posts), **Bitcoin** nearing a key liquidation level at ~$97K, and discussions framing trading as \"gambling\" on Robinhood. This indicates a disconnect; retail is chasing volatility while the broader market backdrop is defensive.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES**\n*   **Technology & AI Competition:** Major theme. Samsung's massive memory chip price hike (Reddit) signals a semiconductor supply crunch, while Amazon's rush to launch an AI chip (RSS News) and NVDA's positive price action (FMP Data) underscore the intense battle for AI infrastructure dominance. Counterpoint: Apple's AI chief stepping down (Reddit) introduces uncertainty for a key player.\n*   **Corporate & Regulatory Friction:** Multiple legal and financial disputes are in focus: Costco vs. Trump tariffs, Starbucks settling labor claims, Altice's billionaire owner bashing lenders, and Ukraine's bond negotiations. This creates a noisy, litigious environment for equities.\n*   **Retail/Meme Stock & Crypto Resurgence:** Clear retail focus on **GME**-related instruments (warrants) and **Bitcoin's** potential to liquidate shorts. This is a sentiment-driven, technical play largely isolated from fundamental news.\n*   **Economic Anxiety:** Underlying concern about consumer strength (Black Friday \"eyebrows\"), political focus on \"taxing the rich\" and affordability, and the UN's call for financial system adaptation point to macro uncertainty.\n\n### **3. IMPORTANT MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (Crypto):** **Bitcoin approaching $96.9K.** A break above could trigger a **$9.6B short liquidation** (per Reddit), creating a massive, volatile squeeze with potential spillover into crypto-correlated equities.\n*   **Sector-Specific Catalyst (Semiconductors):** **Samsung's 60% memory price hike** is a direct, fundamental positive for memory chip makers (MU, WDC, etc.) and related equipment/supply chain. This is a concrete supply-demand signal.\n*   **Technical Signal:** **VIX at 17.24** is elevated but not in panic territory (>20). Suggests hedges are in place and the market is anticipating potential volatility, not currently experiencing it.\n*   **Regulatory Signal:** SEC approval of a new CME clearing house for Treasuries/Repo (RSS News) is a significant infrastructure development for fixed-income markets, potentially increasing efficiency and liquidity.\n\n### **4. PRIMARY RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES**\n**RISKS:**\n1.  **Retail Speculation Blow-off:** The concentrated retail frenzy in GME warrants and crypto could reverse sharply, damaging sentiment in speculative corners of the market.\n2.  **Macro Data Disappointment:** The market is clearly worried about consumer health (Black Friday, affordability). Any weak upcoming data could validate these fears.\n3.  **Liquidity Fragmentation:** High yields and risk premium indicate a preference for safety. This can lead to sharp sell-offs in overvalued or non-profitable segments if liquidity tightens.\n\n**OPPORTUNITIES:**\n1.  **Semiconductor Supply Chain:** The memory chip shortage and price hike create a tangible opportunity in memory producers, chip equipment (AMAT, LRCX), and firms with pricing power.\n2.  **AI Infrastructure Arms Race:** The competitive push from Amazon, Nvidia's resilience, and the broader need for AI compute is a secular growth story. Look for picks-and-shovels plays.\n3.  **Volatility Harvesting:** Elevated VIX and clear event catalysts (Bitcoin level, earnings) make defined-risk options strategies (e.g., iron condors, calendars) attractive for traders.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**SYMBOL: MU (Micron Technology)** - Direct beneficiary of Samsung's memory price hikes. The 60% increase is an extreme industry tailwind. Look for momentum continuation.\n**SYMBOL: NVDA** - Holding strong (green in snapshot) amid the AI chip competition news. Amazon's entry validates the market size but NVDA's ecosystem moat remains the key watch. A break above recent resistance could signal institutional re-engagement.\n**SECTOR: Semiconductor Equipment & Materials** - The memory price surge will drive capital expenditure. Companies like **AMAT, KLAC, LRCX** are critical suppliers and less exposed to single-product competition.\n**THEME: Crypto/Public Equity Correlation** - Monitor **MSTR, COIN, RIOT** for reaction to Bitcoin's $96.9K test. A short squeeze in BTC will likely pump these correlated equities.\n**WATCH: GME & Related Derivatives** - Extreme retail interest in warrants indicates leveraged speculation. This is a high-risk, sentiment-only play. Not for investment; only for traders with strict risk limits. Volatility will be extreme.\n**MACRO: Consumer Discretionary vs. Staples** - Given the affordability concerns, be selective. Favor discount/value retailers over luxury. The \"family restaurant chain closing 1,000 locations\" (RSS News) is a warning sign for the broader casual dining sector.\n\n---\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market is bifurcated. **Institutions are defensive** amid economic uncertainty, while **retail is aggressively speculative**. Focus on fundamental catalysts (semiconductor shortage, AI build-out) over sentiment-driven manias. Position for volatility and be wary of a sudden shift if macro fears overwhelm speculative froth.",

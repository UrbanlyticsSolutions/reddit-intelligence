      "content": "Amazon releases an impressive new AI chip and teases a Nvidia-friendly roadmap\n\nAmazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs.\nThe cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at its AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product in on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.\n\nAWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation, according to AWS.\nAWS says the systems are more than four times faster, with four times more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10 times the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. \nPerhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation.  While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.\nIt is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscience way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  \nAWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, Splashmusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. \n\n\nAWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step-up in performance and support Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  \nThis means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon’s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  \nIt’s worth noting, too, that Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), has become the de facto standard that all AI apps support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon’s cloud.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/",

      "content": "OpenAI declares ‘code red’ as Google catches up in AI race\n\nThe Verge, Dec 2, 2025\n\nGoogle’s own ‘code red’ response to ChatGPT has started paying off.\n\nThe tides are turning in the AI race, and the pressure is getting to OpenAI. Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in.\n\nIn the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said.\n\nThere will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development.\n\nThe newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.\n\nSource: https://www.theverge.com/news/836212/openai-code-red-chatgpt",

      "content": "Is the entire stock market basically a giant confidence game and what happens the day people stop believing in it?\n\nHonestly I’ve been thinking about this way too much lately… sometimes the whole stock market feels like it only works because everyone keeps pretending it works. Like literally the whole thing runs on “confidence,” “sentiment,” “vibes,” whatever you wanna call it. Earnings matter yeah, interest rates matter yeah, but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it’s worth buying. People hold because they trust it’ll go back up. People panic because they think someone else is panicking.\n\nIt’s like one giant circular trust fall. Everyone is basically agreeing not to look down.\n\nAnd then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense? Like not a normal recession or correction, but a day where enough people say “nah I’m done trusting this casino.” Would everything just… unwind? Would indexes tank for years? Would governments step in and force something? Or does the system somehow survive because it’s too big to fail, like people will keep believing simply because they have no choice?\n\nIdk maybe I’m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is. Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating?",

He frequently referenced the market being way too expensive consistently sitting at 20-25X earnings, and mentioned several times that the USA had reached its “apex” (peak) and indexes may not be wise investments as the nation may see prolonged stagnation in terms of growth and earnings — which is why he spent the last chapters of his life seeking value in China, which seemed to disappoint him just as many times as it helped him due to the strict corporate regulations and oversight. \n\nI know it’s just one grumpy old man’s opinion, but it’s very disheartening to see a man who went from bankrupt to billionaire in a little over 30 years, largely through marketable securities, almost blow off the future of investing. He stated numerous times that the upcoming generation should be ready for a lot of disappointment in the markets. \n\nThoughts?",

      "title": "$SNAP will be a 2026 standout",
      "content": "$SNAP will be a 2026 standout\n\nDisclosure: long 250,000 shares at $7.89\n\nI invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike post-Q3 earnings, making about $200k. However, I now look at SNAP as more of a longer-term investment, and my thesis follows:\n\nSince inception, SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can’t make money, which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do. It faces the following issues:\n\n-Founders control the voting rights and haven’t been the best capital allocators.\n\n-Egregious stock-based comp has diluted shareholders.\n\n-Best features (like Stories) copied by META and monetized much better.\n\n-Ad stack worst-in-class.\n\n-Very high operating costs, mainly due to infrastructure.\n\n-Young users, hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power.\n\n-Growing fast mainly in low-income countries like Indian and Pakistan, yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe.\n\nSNAP, as Spiegel mentioned recently, is at a crossroads. It can die a slow, unprofitable death, or it can innovate and start to make money for once. It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now, and I will mention why below:\n\n-Started offering various subscriptions, including Snapchat+, Memories Storage, Lens+, and Platinum. Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $750 million / year for now and is growing double digits, which is unique among its peers. I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan, as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center, such as Icloud storage, Google, etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there. The download and import process isn’t that easy, and there will be friction. A certain number of users will say “screw it, I’ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it”. Meanwhile, the users that do not pay for it will be limited in storage, thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense.\n\n-Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement. After all, what use is having hordes of users if you cannot make money off of them? Sometimes, you indeed have to “fire” your customers.\n\n-They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature, as well as Sponsored Snaps, with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages. The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue.\n\n-They recently reorganized into small, nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy. The Snapchat+ success was created by a small team, for example, so they decided to scale this operationally company-wide.\n\nSNAP has invested billions in its AR tech, and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “thing”, I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology. They have the most used AR products in the world, and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year. Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves, which is also a positive as I don’t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account. Personally, I do not feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success, mainly because SNAP has no record of being successful in hardware. I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well. If they bomb, then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward, which would also be a positive.\n\nWhat investors need to think about is this: How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU? SNAP has that, yet only has a $13 billion market cap. Ideally, the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials. Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs, a better ads platform, and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically. However, I’m not playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares, and a takeover won’t happen unless they want it to happen. More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout.\n\nRegarding stock-based comp, dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped, and while it is still relatively high, management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked. They recently announced a $500 million buyback, and I think we will see more to come.\n\nAs for the recent $400 million Perplexity deal, I see it as a one-off and don’t ascribe much value to it, for now, especially since Evan said they won’t sell advertising against the chatbot results.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year. I don’t have a target price on the stock per se, but it could become a $100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should.",

      "content": "A 'seismic' Nvidia shift, AI chip shortages and how it's threatening to hike gadget prices\n\nAnalysts are starting to flag a new concern: the AI boom is beginning to strain global chip supply chains in a way that could eventually push up the cost of consumer electronics — including smartphones. AI data centers require massive numbers of GPUs and supporting components, and companies like Nvidia, AMD, Google, and Microsoft are all drawing from the same pool of suppliers. As demand accelerates, several parts of the supply chain are struggling to keep up. Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu recently described the situation as “undersupply,” pointing to shortages across chip manufacturers, memory suppliers, and storage device makers and said the bottleneck could last two to three years.\n\nConsultants at Bain &amp; Company highlighted two immediate pressure points: **Hard disk drives (HDDs):** Hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft have pushed HDD capacity to the limit. **Solid-state drives (SSDs):** With HDDs running short, big cloud companies are shifting toward SSDs the same components used in consumer electronics. On top of that, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a stacked version of DRAM crucial for Nvidia’s latest AI chips, is also in tight supply. These constraints ripple backward through the semiconductor ecosystem and raise the cost of parts used in everyday devices. As AI infrastructure spending surges, several key components are facing multi-year shortages. That raises the risk of higher prices — or even limited availability — for some consumer tech products if supply doesn’t catch up soon.",

Speaking at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo, Son said he “was crying” as SoftBank offloaded the stock, which brought in roughly $5.83 billion.\nAccording to Son, the sale wasn’t about lack of confidence in Nvidia. Instead, SoftBank needed the capital to fuel massive upcoming AI investments, including larger bets on OpenAI, data-center infrastructure under the Stargate Project, and its chip ambitions via Ampere Computing. Son reiterated that SoftBank is “all in” on AI and hinted that the firm may expand its OpenAI investment depending on future valuations. SoftBank’s focus on AI has already paid off the conglomerate’s Q2 net profit more than doubled, aided by valuation gains tied to OpenAI. Despite growing market concerns about a potential AI bubble, Son dismissed the skepticism, saying those calling it a bubble are “not smart enough.” He predicts that advanced AI systems and AI robotics could eventually generate at least 10% of global GDP, justifying the scale of current investment.For Son, selling Nvidia shares wasn’t a statement about the chip giant it was a sacrifice to fund what he sees as the next wave of global technological transformation.",

      "content": "Trump expects the Federal Reserve chair nominee to be announced “early next year” and praised Hassett.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his choice for Federal Reserve chair in early 2026 and hinted that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett could be his pick, further fueling speculation about the next leader of the U.S. central bank.\n\n“We may announce the new chair of the Federal Reserve early next year,” Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting.\n\nLast week, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Hassett was considered a potential successor to Powell, and Trump also endorsed this position at another event shortly after Tuesday's cabinet meeting.\n\n“I guess the potential candidate for Fed chair is here too,” Trump said. “I don't know who qualifies for the word ‘potential.’ I can tell you he's a respected individual. Thank you, Kevin.”\n\nTrump's remarks provided a clearer timeline for an announcement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bechtold, who has overseen the selection process, previously indicated the candidate could be revealed around Christmas.\n\nThe president said Tuesday that after consulting with Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Luteinik, he had considered about 10 candidates for the position, but now “we've narrowed it down to one person.”\n\nHowever, it is well known that Trump frequently makes unexpected personnel and policy decisions, meaning the nomination cannot be considered final until formally announced. Other candidates included Federal Reserve Board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Riddell.\n\nFor months, Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's term expires in May, and appointing his successor will be Trump's biggest opportunity yet to reshape the Fed. Trump has criticized Powell for being too slow and cautious on rate cuts, expressing hope that his replacement would push for reductions more aggressively.\n\nTrump again criticized Powell on Tuesday, calling him a “stubborn guy who probably doesn't like your president.” Although Powell's term as chairman ends next year, he could remain on the board as a governor for two more years.\n\nIn September, Trump explicitly named Hassett, Wash, and Waller as his top three candidates. Trump has also repeatedly expressed his desire for Cent to serve as Treasury Secretary, but the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly declined the offer.\n\nThe selection of the Federal Reserve Chair and Board members typically represents the most direct avenue for the President to influence the central bank. However, Trump has consistently criticized the Fed publicly for its sluggish response in lowering borrowing costs and for spending lavishly on renovating its headquarters. Additionally, the White House has filed a lawsuit over Trump's attempt to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\n\nWhoever Trump selects as Fed chair will require Senate confirmation. If the nominee is an outsider, they are likely to receive a 14-year term as a Fed governor, beginning February 1.",

      "title": "Greencoat UKW",
      "content": "Greencoat UKW\n\nThere is constant criticism that this sub doesn't contain high quality posts anymore so as the newest member to the mod team I thought I would do my best to be a part of the solution. If you would prefer to view the thesis somewhere more pleasing to the eye and including relevant graphs and figures then here is a google docs link: [Greencoat UKW](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vST_XMTNnE6VXIs34kI2eqEGNMlPCtUQNJ3CU55bC5Rh1jioh0XW7hy9gCroQ0rmf716Kp-NEKt94QR/pub)\n\nNo AI was used in the making of this other than running calculations that I double checked.\n\n\n\n# Fund Summary\n\nGreencoat UK Wind PLC is a renewable infrastructure fund, invested exclusively in UK wind farms. The fund’s aim is to provide investors with an annual dividend that increases in line with RPI inflation while preserving the capital value of its investment portfolio in the long term on a real basis through reinvestment of excess cash flow.\n\nThe fund is one of the few FTSE 250 listed stocks to raise their dividend for nearly 10 years straight and very well positioned to sustain the dividend growth through the high inflationary period due to revenues being explicitly and implicitly tied to inflation.\n\n# Section 1) Reasons for Discount to Market Cap\n\n# Interest Rates\n\nFor the first \\~7 years of the fund’s life since IPO in 2013 the share price has traded at a modest premium to the NAV however since 2022 that has changed. Over the last 3 years the stock price has slowly traded at a larger and larger discount to NAV with the latest calculation being 140.7p NAV and 99.65p SP meaning a (41.05/140.7p​)×100≈29.17% discount to current NAV.\n\nWhen the “risk free” rate for investors increases, investors demand a higher-dividend yield to assume the risk of owning the fund instead of long term government bonds. Therefore, the stock is sold off until the dividend yield hits a premium more worth the risk. To represent this in the NAV, the fund changed the discount rate it used to calculate current value of future cash flows. NAV is highly sensitive to the discount rate of future cash flows as that causes the current value of those cash flows to be worth far less. As you can see from the 10 Year Gilt rates, 2022 is when the yields started rising due to geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine, which means the discount rate that they used for their calculation of NAV went up from 7% (2021) to 11% (2024) and is the main cause for the declining NAV in that period.\n\nIn their most recent half yearly report, Greencoat state that 0.5% increase in interest rates has a 6.3p negative effect on NAV. While this is offset by increased revenues due to inflation-indexed subsidies and higher realised price per MW/H, it’s overall a largely negative effect on current value of future cash flows.\n\n# Switching to CPI from RPI\n\nThe government is trying to switch everything to track CPI instead of RPI, as it’s the global standard and also reduces its costs. In 2020, it confirmed that the inflation indexed bonds that were previously issued would be switched without any compensation for bond holders.\n\nThe government recently started a discussion into whether payments under the RO and Feed In Tariff schemes should also be switched to CPI. It is also considering freezing rates until backdated “shadow” CPI levels catch up. This would hugely affect renewable energy providers and, as stated by UKW, would drop the NAV by 2.4p for an instant switch to CPI at current levels and by 10.6p for freezing and re-aligning with the “shadow” amount.\n\n# Reduced Average UK Wind Speeds\n\nOver the past 4 years, wind speeds in the UK have been lower than average. This has caused power generation to be well under budgeted estimates and has resulted in lower-than-expected cash flows and therefore smaller dividend cover. This has meant less excess cash to re-invest to maintain NAV and is also likely a cause for investors being cautious in believing NAV calculations.\n\n# Section 2) Management\n\n# Cost of Management\n\nEffective from 1 January 2025, the management fee for running the fund has been based on the lower of the NAV or Market Cap. This is a very shareholder-friendly change which means the management fees are cheaper when the share price is trading at a discount. Based on the earlier calculation of discount to NAV, this means that the fees are also ≈29.17% cheaper.\n\n# Capital Allocation\n\nCapital allocation at the fund since the IPO has been fantastic. They have continuously made decisions that boost the NAV. During periods where the share price was trading at a premium to NAV per share, they did equity financing (share dilution) to raise capital and buy more assets. Whilst many shareholders see dilution as bad for shareholders, when it’s done at above NAV it is accretive for NAV per share.\n\nSince the shares have recently started trading at a discount to NAV, Greencoat have been doing buybacks with excess cash flows because this also increases the NAV per share by reducing shares outstanding. The fund’s ability to be dynamic with its capital allocation will allow them to continue outperforming the market in the long run. The increase in the size of the market for UK wind assets is also likely to provide opportunities to get assets at great prices going forward, as a lot of capital will be required in the industry.\n\n# Section 3) Key Risks\n\n*In no particular order:*\n\n**1.Change from RPI to CPI:** The biggest near-term risk is the potential shift in the indexation measure from RPI to CPI. These will be accounted for in my calculation of expected returns below.\n\n\n\n**2. Reduction of average UK wind speeds:** ([UK wind power potential could fall by 10% by 2100 because of climate change - Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-wind-power-potential-could-fall-2100-because-climate-change/)) There are some studies that suggest we could see lower average wind speeds going forwards, due to climate change. The fund has reduced their estimation of future average wind speeds even though there is no real conclusive evidence that it will happen.\n\n\n\n**3. Valuation Risk:** The fund doesn’t disclose exactly how they calculate NAV and there is some risk that they have made overly optimistic assumptions in this calculation. It’s hard to pin these down but here are some potential worries:\n\na) **Consistently Overestimating Power Generation:** As listed in the ‘UK average wind speeds’ section above, every single year going back to 2016 the fund has underdelivered on power generation, even when UK average wind speeds were higher than expected. This could suggest some incorrect assumptions in the NAV.\n\nb) **Decommissioning Liabilities:** (Source: [Greencoat Flapping in the Wind - by David Turver](https://davidturver.substack.com/p/greencoat-flapping-in-the-wind)) \n\n“Note 10 to their accounts identifies about £280m of guarantees and indemnities made by the company to cover things like decommissioning and other indemnities. However, Note 2 records that they consider the fair value of these indemnities to be zero because they “do not expect Group cashflows to crystalise as a result of these guarantees”.\n\nHowever, this might not be the full extent of the under-recording of decommissioning liabilities. For instance, Note 10 indicates a guarantee to the Crown Estate of £3.4m for the decommissioning of Rhyl Flats offshore wind farm. However, the 2023 accounts for[ Rhyl Flats](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/05485961/filing-history) shows the present value of decommissioning liabilities of £29.2m. Grossing this up using their discount rate of 3.75% to the expected life of 23 years gives an expected cash cost of some £40.7m in 2032. UKW owns 24.95% of Rhyl Flats, so its share of the total would be £10.2m, three times more than the amount recorded in Note 10.\n\nSimilarly, they record in Note 10 a guarantee of £11.8m to cover decommissioning and rent for[ North Hoyle](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/02904841/filing-history) wind farm. However, the 2024 accounts declare a provision for decommissioning with a present value of £12.1m. Grossing this up to their discount rate of 6% out to 2034 gives a cash cost of £21.7m. UKW owns 100% of North Hoyle, so it will be on the hook for the entire amount, nearly double the recorded guarantee.”\n\n\n\n**4.Political Risk:** The conservative party has stated that they would scrap certain renewable subsidies if they were in government and Reform would likely try to do the same. Whilst these subsidies are bound by contract and likely hard to legally get out of, this still poses a risk of impacting future cash flows. The only way to account for this would be to use a lower growth rate for NAV in expected returns as a form of margin of safety.\n\n\n\n**5. Assets Life Risk:** The fund lists asset life as one of its keys risks and says “In the event that the wind turbines do not operate for the period of time assumed by the Group or require higher than expected maintenance expenditure to do so, it could have a material adverse effect on investment returns.\n\nThe Group performs regular reviews and ensures that maintenance is performed on all wind turbines across the wind farm portfolio. Regular maintenance ensures the wind turbines are in good working order, consistent with their expected life-spans.”\n\n\n\n**6. Electricity Prices:** Quite obvious, but a material drop in energy prices for an extended period of time would substantially hurt the fund’s cash flows. This risk feels very small to me – with huge data centres the increased load to the grid for electric cars and a widespread shift away from fossil fuel generation demand for power is very likely to stay high. They are also calculating NAV based on their realised price per MW/H dropping from £60 down to below £40 in 2060.\n\n# Section 4) Expected Returns\n\nTo make it easy, I will just calculate NAV and assume dividends are left in cash within the fund. (Rate of return will be higher if, at below NAV, dividends are re-invested and/or buybacks happen.)\n\n# Optimistic Outlook: Share Price Returns to NAV within 3 years and NAV grows at 10% (The fund’s target)\n\n**Current Share Price:** 99.65p\n\n**NAV After 3 years:** 187.27p  \nEnding NAV=140.7p×(1.10)\\^3=187.27p\n\n**Total Return Over 3 Years:**  \nTotal Return=(Ending NAV/Starting SP)​−1 =(187.27p/99.65p)​−1≈1.8793−1=87.93%\n\n**Annualised Rate of Return (CAGR):**  \nCAGR=((1+Total Return)\\^⅓)−1  \nCAGR=((1.8793)\\^⅓)−1≈0.2340=**23.40%**\n\n# Base Case: Switch to CPI instantly (-2.4p NAV), Share Price Returns to 90% of NAV within 3 years and NAV grows at 8%\n\n**Current Share Price:** 99.65p\n\n**NAV After 3 years:** 174.22p  \nEnding NAV=138.3p×(1.08)\\^3=174.22p\n\n**Total Return Over 3 Years:**  \n Total Return=(Ending NAV/Starting SP)​−1 =(174.22p/99.65p)​−1≈1.7483−1=74.83%\n\n**Annualised Rate of Return (CAGR):**  \nCAGR=((1+Total Return)\\^⅓)−1  \nCAGR=((1.7483)\\^⅓)−1≈0.2047=**20.47%**\n\n# Pessimistic Outlook: Freeze at current rate and switch to “shadow” CPI Rate (-10.6p NAV), Share Price Stays at current discount to NAV and NAV grows at 8% for 3 years\n\n**Current Share Price:** 99.65p\n\n**Starting NAV** 130.1p\n\n**Nav After 3 Years:** 174.22p  \nEnding NAV=130.1p×(1.08)\\^3=163.89p\n\n**Current Discount:** 1−(99.65p/140.7p)=**29.17%**\n\n**End Price with Discount:** 163.89p\\*(1-0.2917)=116.08p\n\n**Total Return Over 3 Years:**  \n Total Return=(Ending NAV/Starting SP)​−1 =(116.08p/99.65p)​−1≈1.1649−1=**16.49%**\n\n**Annualised Rate of Return (CAGR):**  \nCAGR=((1+Total Return)\\^⅓)−1  \nCAGR=((1.1649)\\^⅓)−1≈0.05=**5%**\n\nFor this pessimistic outlook to be true, the worst-case decision for the switch to CPI would need to happen (this would hugely disincentivise future investment in renewables, making net-zero 2050 and clean power by 2030 a lot harder to achieve) plus the fund would have to miss its target returns by 2% annually. I’ve chosen 2% to account for the fact that Greencoat have missed their generation estimates by an average of 2.4% since 2013. In their 2024 annual report they revised future estimated wind speeds down by 2.4% (conveniently similar) but I’m just being conservative. All of this, as well as the fund still trading at a 29% discount to ending NAV, means I calculate the CAGR is still 5%.\n\n# Section 5) Potential Tailwinds Not Included\n\nAll of the above is very much looking into worst case scenarios, I'm very much of the opinion that 1st priority in investing should be making sure that you don’t lose money and the upside will take care of itself. That being said here are some of the things that could materially increase returns:\n\n1. Reduction in interest rates would hugely boost NAV. For example, if interest rates in 3 years were 2% then that would add 26.8p to current NAV.\n2. Rise in electricity costs would increase dividend coverage and allow buybacks and potential acquisitions of new sites to increase NAV – or simply allow for special one-time dividends like they have done in the past (should be a last resort if no other capital allocation is available at high compound rate of returns).\n3. An expected increase in on-shore windfarms by 2x and off-shore by 3x means that constructors will be looking for lots of buyers to free up capital to start on new projects, potentially creating opportunities for effective use of capital at higher rates of return.\n4. Buybacks at current prices are VERY efficient due to the discount to NAV and reduce the dividend burden by reducing shares outstanding.\n5. The stock price could return to NAV at a faster rate than 3 years, which would make CAGR for the investment higher but over less time.\n6. Stock price could return to trading at a premium to NAV like it did for the first 7 years of the fund's life.\n7. Battery storage on site at wind farms could increase returns by allowing flexibility for delivering power at periods with the highest demand. This currently does not offer good rates of return but as battery technology improves it’s something the fund is investigating. (Wind power provides the best opportunity for this as a lot of power is generated overnight during periods of low demand)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThanks very much if you got this far, you have a much better attension span than most, please do let me know what you think and no need to be too kind, feel free to rip my thesis apart.\n\nI do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.\n\nI have taken a 20,000 share position and will be looking to build on it should there be any further discount to the stock price.",

Not putting into a Roth or 401k or anything because my plan was to use that money and put a down payment on a house in a few years and move out. \n\nCurrently 38k Saved up. (in VOO and VYMI) but if the ETF's crash, less than that\n\nJust bought a truck, have 27k left to pay off. Took a 5 year loan and 5.5% interest rate.\n\n7.5k in school loans, 7.7% interest. Payments have been frozen for a few years because of all the stuff going on but just started up again yesterday.\n\nBring home \\~$2700 a month\n\nWith that information out of the way, here's my question. Would it make sense to just empty the money from the investing and pay off the truck and school loans? It would be like starting fresh with my investing again, but there would be no debt, no interest. I could potentially save up to that again pretty fast just putting the money i was paying into the truck and school loans and put it month by month into the investing.\n\nI know its kind of a numbers game and no one knows whats going to happen with the economy, so that 38k could disappear overnight. \n\nI feel it kind of comes down to the interest i pay on the loans vs how much i would be making on the investments. Again, just trying to get some perspectives on what others would do. Thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Invest in ETFs or 5.75% mortgage, or both?\n\nHi all,\n\nI’ve been browsing several investment and homeowner subs and I’m still unsure what makes the most sense financially. From what I’ve read, the consensus seems to be that the decision basically depends on mortgage interest rate. Seems like ~6% is sort of the grey area. Ours is 5.75%.\n\nA little over a year ago, I got a much better job so my income level is relatively high but I’ve only recently been able to contribute meaningfully (pretty much at all) to retirement and savings. Right now, I’m maxing my Roth IRA, HSA, and 401(k). We also just bought a house with a 5.75% mortgage. From what I understand, investing in broad ETFs like VTI and VXUS would historically yield more than 5.75% in the long run (like ~8%?), so I could potentially grow my wealth faster by investing. I feel a bit behind in savings for my age (31) and could afford to put money in now to try to catch up.\n\nBut, I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal, especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later. I’m wondering if it’s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns, or if there are other factors I should consider. Maybe it is best to do some of both? \n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Tax considerations when selling a treasury bond for profit\n\nJust wanted to double check my understanding on selling a treasury bond that has increased in value. (I’ve previously always just held to maturity). \n\n\nHold to maturity: \n\nIncome is state/local tax free. \n\nSell the bond for a profit on the secondary market: \n\nIncome is effectively a short term capital gain where both state/local and federal taxes apply. \n\n\nSo in California where my state taxes are ~10%, I should only sell the bond if the face value of the bond is 10% lower than the secondary market price. \n\nIs my understanding correct here?",

      "content": "Major Drilling Group - shovel play or nvidia in mining?\n\nThe U.S. plans to reduce its reliance on Chinese rare earth elements (REE) by boosting domestic production. While I don’t want to invest in junior miners, and I already have some exposure to senior miners, the opportunity here seems clear to me.\n\nIt’s a no-brainer: whether it’s juniors or seniors expanding exploration, they all need drilling services first. That’s where a company like Major Drilling stands to benefit, regardless of which miner ultimately succeeds.\n\nI’m considering going all-in ahead of their earnings report. Is anyone else already invested in this idea or in Major Drilling itself?",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Time Horizon:** Day | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-02 17:25:28  \n**Overall Market Sentiment:** **Neutral-to-Bearish with Elevated Anxiety**\n\nThe market is caught between conflicting forces: strong retail speculative energy, significant systemic risk warnings, and mixed macro signals. While major indices may appear steady (per Asian markets wrap), underlying stress is evident in repo markets, political uncertainty, and concentrated retail focus on volatile assets.\n\n---\n\n### **1. KEY THEMES**\n\n**A. Systemic & Collateral Stress (High Conviction)**\n*   **Reddit:** Dominant theme is banks \"dumping mortgage-backed securities for cash\" at the Fed's overnight repo facility, interpreted as collateral stress and potential insolvency risk.\n*   **Macro Context:** This aligns with a high Fed Funds Rate (3.89%) and significant unrealized losses in bank bond portfolios. It signals potential liquidity tightness in the banking system, a bearish macro risk.\n\n**B. Political & Policy Uncertainty Driving Volatility**\n*   **Reddit & News:** Political narratives are front and center. Themes include Trump's comments on inflation (\"Democrat scam\"), USDA funding pauses, and companies (e.g., Costco) suing for tariff refunds. This injects uncertainty into fiscal policy and regulatory outlook.\n*   **News:** The EU's deal to phase out Russian gas by 2027 is a long-term structural shift with inflationary implications for European energy costs.\n\n**C. Speculative Retail Mania & Meme Stock Resurgence**\n*   **Reddit:** Clear focus on **$GME** (warrants \"acting fucky,\" Schwab restricting call buying), **crypto** (Bitcoin volatility, Eric Trump's firm crash), and options/gambling culture (Robinhood post). This indicates a high-risk, momentum-driven retail cohort is active.\n*   **Data:** Large, rapid moves in assets like Bitcoin ($140M bearish bets vanished) and single-stock gains (e.g., mongoDB $586k gain post) exemplify this environment.\n\n**D. AI & Tech Resilience Amidst Churn**\n*   **Reddit/News:** **$NVDA** comeback story and **$AMZN** new AI chip announcement provide a bullish counter-narrative within tech.\n*   **Market Data:** **$INTC's** significant +8.65% gain suggests potential rotation or idiosyncratic news within semiconductors, contrasting with broader market anxiety.\n\n**E. Inflation & Affordability as Persistent Concerns**\n*   Cross-source theme: Reddit political posts, Bloomberg news (\"Never Seen Affordability Crisis Like This\"), and elevated CPI (324.368) all highlight that inflation remains a key market and social driver, complicating the Fed's path.\n\n---\n\n### **2. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n\n*   **Critical Warning Signal:** The **overnight repo activity** is the most urgent signal. If banks are indeed swapping MBS for cash en masse, it suggests mounting pressure that could precede a \"credit event\" or forced deleveraging. This demands close monitoring of financial sector ETFs ($KRE, $XLF) and credit spreads.\n*   **Retail Sentiment Signal:** Broker restrictions (Schwab on GME calls) often precede or accompany high volatility in meme stocks. This, combined with high Reddit scores on these topics, signals **elevated near-term volatility risk for $GME and related meme equities**.\n*   **Contrarian Bull Signal:** The \"S&P 493\" discussion highlights market breadth issues. If the mega-cap tech rally (driven by AI like NVDA, AMZN) falters without broader participation, it's a market top warning. However, strength in names like INTC may hint at broadening.\n*   **Macro Catalyst:** **Silver steady near record highs** (on rate-cut bets and tight supply) is a notable tell. Silver often acts as a hybrid inflation/industrial metal/risk-on asset. Its strength alongside rate-cut hopes suggests markets are betting on a \"growth scare\" prompting Fed easing, not purely inflation.\n\n---\n\n### **3. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n\n| Priority | Risk/Opportunity | Source Evidence |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **HIGH** | **Financial System Liquidity Crunch** | Reddit repo warnings, high Fed Funds Rate, bank unrealized losses. |\n| **HIGH** | **Sharp Volatility in Speculative Assets** | Concentrated Reddit discussion on GME, crypto, options gambling; broker restrictions. |\n| **MED-HIGH**| **Political & Policy Surprises** | Trump-related policy headlines (USDA, tariffs, inflation rhetoric) creating uncertainty. |\n| **MED** | **Inflation Persistence & Fed Error** | Elevated CPI, affordability crisis news, silver rally. Risk of \"higher for longer\" or premature easing. |\n| **MED** | **Concentrated Market Leadership** | \"S&P 493\" theme, reliance on NVDA/tech. A rotation or tech sell-off could spill over broadly. |\n| **OPPORTUNITY** | **AI & Selective Tech Strength** | NVDA/AMZN news, INTC price action. AI infrastructure remains a clear investment theme. |\n| **OPPORTUNITY** | **Rate-Sensitive Rebound** | If repo stress forces a Fed pivot sooner than expected, bonds (TLT) and beaten-down growth stocks could rally sharply. |\n\n---\n\n### **4. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n\n**For Traders (Day/Short-Term):**\n*   **$GME / Meme Basket:** Expect extreme volatility. **Schwab's restriction is a major red flag** often preceding downward pressure. Consider elevated put/call skew or avoid entirely due to unpredictable gamma effects.\n*   **$VIX / $UVXY:** The cocktail of repo stress, political noise, and meme volatility suggests **volatility is underpriced** at VIX ~17.24. Long volatility hedges are prudent.\n*   **Regional Banks ($KRE):** Monitor for weakness as the primary vector for collateral/MBS stress. A break below key support could signal broader risk-off.\n\n**For Investors (Strategic/Positioning):**\n*   **SECTOR: Financials ($XLF):** **Underweight or hedge.** The repo signal is too aligned with known balance sheet risks. Prefer large, globally-systemic banks over regionals.\n*   **$TLT / Long-Duration Bonds:** **Accumulate cautiously.** Market is pricing in eventual Fed response to stress. A flight-to-quality or policy pivot would benefit long bonds, but beware sticky inflation.\n*   **SECTOR: Commodities & Energy:** **Tactical overweight.** EU's Russian gas phase-out (bullish nat gas), silver strength, and oil holding amid war uncertainty suggest resilient commodity complex. Consider $XLE, $SLV.\n*   **$NVDA, $AMZN, $INTC:** **Differentiate.** AI theme is intact (NVDA, AMZN), but INTC's surge may be company-specific. Use any broad market dip driven by macro fears to add to AI leaders, not the semi sector broadly.\n\n**Critical Watchlist:**\n1.  **Fed Overnight Repo Facility Balances:** Next day's data is **crucial**. An increase confirms stress.\n2.  **Bitcoin ($BTC):** A break above $91k could fuel broader retail risk-on sentiment; a rejection may signal risk appetite exhaustion.\n3.  **10Y Treasury Yield (4.09%):** A sharp move **below 4.0%** would be a strong signal the bond market is pricing in imminent financial stress or growth fears.\n\n**Conclusion:** The market is on a knife's edge. **Retail is chasing speculative dreams while institutional plumbing shows cracks.** The dominant action is **defensive positioning and preparation for volatility**. Prioritize capital preservation, hedge with volatility products, and wait for clarity on the financial stress signal before committing new long-term capital. The largest near-term risk is not a slow decline, but a **liquidity-driven flash event** originating from the shadows of the banking system.",

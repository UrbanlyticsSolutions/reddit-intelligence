      "content": "ADP data shows sharp slowdown in the U.S. labor market as small businesses struggle\n\nThe latest ADP numbers for November paint a much weaker picture of the labor market than expected. Private employers cut 32,000 jobs, which is a big swing from October’s revised gain of 47,000 and way below the forecast of +40,000.The biggest pressure seems to be on small businesses. Companies with fewer than 50 employees shed a total of 120,000 jobs, the largest drop since March 2023. Medium and large employers actually added workers, with bigger firms showing a net gain of 90,000.Hiring was mixed across sectors. Education and health services added 33,000 jobs, and leisure/hospitality added 13,000. But those gains were offset by declines in professional/business services (-26,000), information (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial and construction (-9,000 each). Wage growth is also cooling, with job-stayers seeing a 4.4% YoY pay increase a slight slowdown from October. This report lands right before the Fed meeting on Dec 9–10. Markets are pricing in nearly a 90% chance of another 25 bps rate cut, but Fed officials remain split: some argue easing is needed to prevent further labor weakness, while others worry cuts could push inflation the wrong way. The BLS nonfarm payrolls data, delayed to Dec 16, will be the next key datapoint.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/adp-jobs-report-november-2025-private-payrolls-unexpectedly-fell-by-32000-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/adp-jobs-report-november-2025-private-payrolls-unexpectedly-fell-by-32000-.html)",

Ever since the C+35 on the warrants, we have been steadily going up and warrants have been exploding. I believe there are so few warrants available to cover the FTDs for the warrants that they are resorting to buying GME1 options contracts the satisfy the obilagations. By doing so, they are forcing the options MM to hedge and get real shares of GME and to scramble for the warrants they were supposed to have. Hence why both GME and warrants are going up. If warrant demands explodes even more and more retail FOMOS, I think we will see explosions. What are your guy's thoughts?

      "content": "IBM CEO says there is 'no way' spending trillions on AI data centers will pay off at today's infrastructure costs\n\nArvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, has argued that the recent surge in spending by Big Tech on AI-data centers is economically unrealistic. On the “Decoder” podcast he estimated that building and fully outfitting a one-gigawatt AI data center costs about $80 billion. Given that industry announcements suggest firms are planning up to 100 gigawatts of compute capacity, the total capital expenditure could reach around $8 trillion, which would require roughly $800 billion in profits just to cover interest.  \n\n\nKrishna also highlighted that AI hardware like GPUs depreciates quickly and often needs to be replaced roughly every five years, which further undermines long-term financial returns. He said he believes the likelihood of achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI) with current technology is between zero and one percent, making the massive infrastructure bets more speculative than certain. \n\nStill, Krishna acknowledged the potential of today’s AI tools to deliver significant enterprise productivity gains. He cautioned that while infrastructure-heavy “AGI-race” spending may not pay off, more modest, business-focused AI deployments could still be worthwhile.\n\n[Link to article](https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-ceo-big-tech-ai-capex-data-center-spending-2025-12)",

Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in.\n\nIn the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said.\n\nThere will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development.\n\nThe newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.\n\nSource: https://www.theverge.com/news/836212/openai-code-red-chatgpt",

He frequently referenced the market being way too expensive consistently sitting at 20-25X earnings, and mentioned several times that the USA had reached its “apex” (peak) and indexes may not be wise investments as the nation may see prolonged stagnation in terms of growth and earnings — which is why he spent the last chapters of his life seeking value in China, which seemed to disappoint him just as many times as it helped him due to the strict corporate regulations and oversight. \n\nI know it’s just one grumpy old man’s opinion, but it’s very disheartening to see a man who went from bankrupt to billionaire in a little over 30 years, largely through marketable securities, almost blow off the future of investing.

      "content": "ADP data shows sharp slowdown in the U.S. labor market as small businesses struggle\n\nThe latest ADP numbers for November paint a much weaker picture of the labor market than expected. Private employers cut 32,000 jobs, which is a big swing from October’s revised gain of 47,000 and way below the forecast of +40,000.The biggest pressure seems to be on small businesses. Companies with fewer than 50 employees shed a total of 120,000 jobs, the largest drop since March 2023. Medium and large employers actually added workers, with bigger firms showing a net gain of 90,000.Hiring was mixed across sectors. Education and health services added 33,000 jobs, and leisure/hospitality added 13,000. But those gains were offset by declines in professional/business services (-26,000), information (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial and construction (-9,000 each). Wage growth is also cooling, with job-stayers seeing a 4.4% YoY pay increase a slight slowdown from October.This report lands right before the Fed meeting on Dec 9–10. Markets are pricing in nearly a 90% chance of another 25 bps rate cut, but Fed officials remain split: some argue easing is needed to prevent further labor weakness, while others worry cuts could push inflation the wrong way.The BLS nonfarm payrolls data, delayed to Dec 16, will be the next key datapoint.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/adp-jobs-report-november-2025-private-payrolls-unexpectedly-fell-by-32000-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/adp-jobs-report-november-2025-private-payrolls-unexpectedly-fell-by-32000-.html)",

We have CES 2026 coming up early January where the Panther Lake chips will be fully revealed on 18A and benchmarks are already promising, then we have rumors about incoming foundry deals and lately a lot of demand for EMIB which is specialized chip packaging. Also Intels discrete GPU division is also looking better than ever (note on this is that we do have to find out how nvidia deal will affect this in the future).\n\n  \nCurrently Intel is at only \\~60% of AMD's market cap while making over two times their revenue. When more of Intels in house chips move to in-house fabbing margins will increase a lot because they don't have to pay TSMC 50% profit margins anymore. Flight potential for this stock is absurd and insanely assymetrical, even after the jump over the past few months.\n\nIn nana we trust.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zkbgas0dz4g1.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=382bb35a03fcb83481ed5c7e1fe7a76ac4e5b5f9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3tqvr8zcz4g1.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73dd2876116b9d739fcd2012a53df85525af60da\n\n  \n",

      "content": "Macy’s drops 7% pre-market on strongest growth in 3 years while raising outlook and warning on holiday spending and tariffs\n\nNo paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/macys-m-earnings-q3-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/macys-m-earnings-q3-2025.html)\n\n&gt;Macy’s on Wednesday beat Wall Street’s sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company’s turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum.\n\n&gt;The department store operator raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook after its better-than-expected fiscal third quarter. The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $2 and $2.20, up from its previous expectation of $1.70 to $2.05, and net sales of $21.48 billion to $21.63 billion, compared with its prior outlook of $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion.\n\n&gt;Macy’s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5% comparable sales growth from the previous year. That compares to its previous expectations for a year-over-year decline of between 0.5% and 1.5%. The industry metric takes out one-time dynamics like store openings and closures, and Macy’s includes merchandise that it owns, items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its third-party online marketplace.\n\n&gt;It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy’s raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook. The company had cut its full-year earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs, more promotions and “some moderation” in discretionary spending. \n\n&gt;Even so, the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the year-ago net sales of $22.29 billion. Macy’s said about $700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 1, and in the early part of this fiscal year. \n\n&gt;And Macy’s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter.\n\n&gt;Shares dropped about 6% in premarket trading on Wednesday.\n\n&gt;In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “prudent view” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough year-over-year comparisons and because it’s not sure how “aspirational customers,” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured, may spend during the season.\n\n&gt;“We’re pleased with the fourth quarter to date, but we have a big holiday in front of us,” he said. \n\n&gt;He said Macy’s department store model is an advantage during the gift-giving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices, from off-price to luxury.\n\n&gt;Here’s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n&gt;Earnings per share: 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents \n\n&gt;Revenue: $4.71 billion vs. $4.62 billion expected\n\n&gt;Macy’s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales, particularly for its namesake brand. Macy’s department stores account for the majority of the New York City-based legacy retailer’s business, but their performance has lagged behind the company’s higher-end department store, Bloomingdale’s, and beauty chain, Bluemercury. To try to reverse that trend, the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing, sharper merchandise and eye-catching displays at Macy’s stores. It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations, which were dubbed the “First 50,” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy’s locations. That’s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy’s plans to keep open.\n\n&gt;Along with the added investment, it has shuttered lower-performing Macy’s locations. It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027, while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury. \n\n&gt;The company hasn’t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year. \n\n&gt;In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Macy’s net income fell to $11 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $28 million, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for some one-time items, including gains on the sale of real estate, it reported earnings per share of 9 cents.\n\n&gt;Revenue decreased from $4.74 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\n&gt;In the fiscal third quarter, companywide comparable sales rose 3.2% including owned and licensed merchandise and its third-party marketplace. When the company excluded stores that won’t be part of its go-forward business, that growth was 3.4%.\n\n&gt;Bloomingdale’s posted the strongest performance of the company’s brands, with comparable sales jumping 9% year over year on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including its third-party marketplace. And Bluemercury’s comparable sales increased 1.1%.\n\n&gt;Spring attributed the company’s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy’s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like high-end home goods company MacKenzie-Childs.\n\n&gt;He said he visited Macy’s stores, and those of its competitors, on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw.\n\n&gt;“I like the way we’re showing up,” he said. “We look crisp. We look clean. We look interesting, compelling, inspiring, easy to shop.”\n\n&gt;The snap to cooler weather helped, too, he said. As temperatures turned cooler in October, shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters, outerwear and boots.\n\n&gt;For the holiday season, Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the year-ago period at Macy’s stores and website, along with those of its competitors.\n\n&gt;Higher tariffs, however, will mean higher prices for some items. Macy’s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties, and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected, he said.\n\n&gt;Still, Spring said Macy’s has made “selective” price increases in almost every category, with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs.\n\n&gt;As of Tuesday’s close, Macy’s shares have risen about 34% so far this year. That outpaces the S&amp;P 500′s 16% gains during the same period. Macy’s stock closed Tuesday at $22.71, bringing the company’s market cap to about $6.10 billion.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g45musmosz4g1.png?width=1585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70496b4725ed086e3479e1289b4f531be77c56e1",

Given SoftBank had been one of the more notable backers in the OneWeb–Eutelsat merger, the move naturally raised a few eyebrows. Eutelsat is still trying to position itself as a serious competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink, but scaling satellite broadband isn’t cheap, and investor sentiment has been shaky since the merger.A stake cut doesn’t necessarily mean SoftBank is abandoning the story they’ve been reshuffling exposure across different AI and connectivity bets lately but the timing does add pressure, especially when the company is already navigating heavy capex needs and slow commercial uptake compared to Starlink.",

According to The Information, many sales reps in Azure’s AI unit struggled to hit last year’s growth numbers, especially around the Foundry product the platform companies use to build and manage AI agents. Lowering quotas is apparently unusual for Microsoft, which makes the move stand out. It also raises a question about how quickly enterprise demand for these AI-agent tools is actually scaling versus the expectations that were set last year. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report yet, but if true, it might signal that the enterprise AI ramp-up is going to be more uneven than people assumed. Curious how others read this growing pains, or an early sign that AI adoption inside large companies is slower than the narrative suggests?\n Source : https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/microsoft-stock-ai-foundry-sales.html",

      "content": "Invest in ETFs or 5.75% mortgage, or both?\n\nHi all,\n\nI’ve been browsing several investment and homeowner subs and I’m still unsure what makes the most sense financially. From what I’ve read, the consensus seems to be that the decision basically depends on mortgage interest rate. Seems like ~6% is sort of the grey area. Ours is 5.75%.\n\nA little over a year ago, I got a much better job so my income level is relatively high but I’ve only recently been able to contribute meaningfully (pretty much at all) to retirement and savings. Right now, I’m maxing my Roth IRA, HSA, and 401(k). We also just bought a house with a 5.75% mortgage. From what I understand, investing in broad ETFs like VTI and VXUS would historically yield more than 5.75% in the long run (like ~8%?), so I could potentially grow my wealth faster by investing. I feel a bit behind in savings for my age (31) and could afford to put money in now to try to catch up.\n\nBut, I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal, especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later. I’m wondering if it’s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns, or if there are other factors I should consider. Maybe it is best to do some of both? \n\nThank you!",

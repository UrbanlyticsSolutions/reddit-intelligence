      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Friday.",

      "content": "Trump Media Technology Group shares surged 40% today. ​​It seems the blonde guy is back to playing the stock market again.\n\nTrump Media &amp; Technology Group surged a staggering 40% today, with the intraday rally clearly not the work of “normal capital.” Honestly, seeing this move, my first thought wasn't fundamentals it was whether that blond guy was back in the game personally “stoking the fire.”\n\nA single word from him can instantly make the stock price defy gravity. The question is: Is this 40% surge the start of a new rally, or are old players looking for buyers at these high levels?\n\nI'm a bit conflicted myself:\n\nOn one hand, you can never underestimate the “madness” of this stock using traditional logic;\n\nOn the other hand, chasing it at these levels easily turns you into the “last one holding the bag.”\n\nSo I'd love to hear your thoughts\n\nDo you see any worthwhile opportunities here?\n\nIs this a short term bet, an event driven play, or have you completely written off stocks like this?",

Just sit it out like Buffett or just put some money in the S&amp;P 500 and that's it. Save it for \"good times\" which are the opposite for \"normal\" investors.\n\n**\"This stock went up 700%, is this stock good?\"**\n\nIf the only value you see is that the stock went up by 700%+, that's not value investing...\n\n**\"Should I buy Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, XYZ?\"**\n\nWhat about you do your own DD and stay in your area of competence. If you don't know why a stock went up, you won't understand why it goes down...\n\nYou should know when a company is undervalued and when it's overpriced.\n\n**\"I bought a stock one month ago, it went down 5%, should I sell?\"**\n\nIf you truly did your DD and you are a value investor, you just sit it out. You have time; you bought to hold it for years. I have stocks in my portfolio for over 10 years...\n\nI could go on and on and on, like trimming your portfolio every month, just looking at the numbers and not understanding the company, etc., etc., etc.!\n\n  \n**\"This stock dipped 30% everybody all in\"** \n\nI heard this story 100s times, I always ask, what makes you believe that it will go up again ? If you dont have a good answer dont buy! \n\n  \n\n\nIt's not that difficult to be a value investor. All you need is:\n\n**Benjamin Graham - The Intelligent Investor**\n\nMake sure you truly understand it, I needed time to understand it fully! If you are too lazy to read one book, you probably don't have the discipline to be a value investor.\n\nBonus: If this book is to \"difficult\" (no shame in that, I started very very slow) start with Peter Lynch + Youtube New Money.\n\nMost of you have the knowledge but some here either dont understand Valueinvesting or simply dont have the dispcpline and try to chase quick returns.\n\nEverything I do isnt based on my \"opinion\" or community posts its based on the tools of people who 100x smarter than me like Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham etc.\n\nWith these tools I try to find \"gaps\" in the marked and thats it. Sometimes it takes years sometimes only month. I have time!",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

The Christmas rally may be quietly approaching.\n\n* NVDA: Buy on dips, await bullish reversal.\n* MSFT: Trading within a range; consider going long only after it returns to 490.\n* AMZN: First stop-loss level at 220, second stop-loss level at 210.\n* AAPL: Look to 276. Only a break above 276 signals an upward trend.\n* GOOG: Faces resistance at 305. Look for a rebound near 310 to turn bullish; otherwise, remain bearish.\n* META: Wait for a pullback near 660 to confirm new support before going long.\n* TSLA: Facing strong resistance at 490, unable to boost valuation.

But Google's TPU performance shows that big techs can rely on their own custom chips rather than buying from Nvidia or AMD.

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions. These bonds would likely be best suited in a retirement account due to the federal, state, and local tax implications.",

      "content": "Clustered 10b5-1 plan adoptions at Wave Life Sciences, normal or notable?\n\nI’m looking for feedback from people who’ve looked at insider trading patterns before.\n\nWave Life Sciences (WVE) stock jumped \\~3x on December 8 following positive interim trial results. On that same day, 8 executives/directors executed stock sales under 10b5-1 plans. I understand the same-day execution is plausibly explained by price-based triggers or limit orders.\n\nHowever, I saw that the 8 plans that executed on December 8 were initiated in two clusters:\n\n* 3 plans on March 13, 2025\n* 5 plans on August 6, 2025\n\nI pulled Form 4 data for Wave from 2024–2025 to look closer at this pattern and wrote up the details here [https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/](https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/)\n\nMy question:  \nI'm relatively new to this. Is this kind of clustered 10b5-1 adoption and execution fairly typical in biotech or other industries? Is this easily explained by compensation cycles/normal planning, or is this something you’d flag as worth a second look? \n\nI haven't yet benchmarked against a larger sample of biotech companies, that's on my list if this is indeed notable.",

However, I’ve recently been considering making some changes so I can invest more aggressively and potentially see better returns in the far future.\n\nI’m in it for the long haul so it’s a case of just set it and forget it (I’m in my 20’s).

      "content": "How do you research and choose your picks?\n\nHi all,\n\nI’m looking for some advice and guidance as I’m fairly new to investing outside of ETFs. Up until now, I’ve mainly stuck with ETFs because they feel simpler, more diversified, and easier to understand as a beginner. Lately though, I’ve been thinking about branching out into individual companies, but I’m finding the process a bit overwhelming.\n\nThere seems to be a huge sea of options when it comes to stocks, across different industries, markets, and levels of risk. With so many companies to choose from, I’m curious how you all narrow things down and decide which ones are worth researching further. Do you start by looking at industries you’re already familiar with, or do you screen based on financial metrics like revenue growth, profitability, or valuation ratios?\n\nI’m also interested in learning what your research process looks like before you actually invest. For example, how much weight do you put on a company’s financial statements versus things like management quality, competitive advantages, or long-term growth potential? Are there specific tools, websites, or resources you rely on to help with analysis?\n\nFinally, I’d love to know how you manage risk when investing in individual stocks, especially compared to ETFs. Any tips, common mistakes to avoid, or lessons learned from your own experiences would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for any insights you’re willing to share.",

Now I find myself in a position where a large percentage of my portfolio is in this single security and I'm looking to diversify.\n\nI have been told that enhanced direct indexing is a good option for unwinding a concentrated position. I'm a novice here but if I understand it correctly, for a non-trivial fee, a management firm will use my concentrated position as leverage to buy long and short positions and use tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains, effectively diversifying while deferring the large taxable event.\n\nAre there big inherent risks I'm not aware of? Are there other options I should consider? I recognize there's a real risk by having nearly half of my portfolio in a single security but I don't want to make a mistake and take an even greater risk trying to unwind it. \n\nThanks!",

MARKET SENTIMENT: **Bearish with Elevated Anxiety**  \n- **Reddit sentiment** is dominated by warnings (\"Extreme media fud,\" \"Witching Day,\" debt concerns) and skepticism (housing data critique, \"Zero they say\"). Retail traders appear defensive, with mentions of GME volatility and mining windfalls reflecting speculative pockets but overall caution.  \n- **Macro data** shows a rising 10Y Treasury yield (4.16%), elevated VIX (16.87), and high inflation (CPI 325.031). The US Equity Risk Premium (4.33%) suggests equities are compensating for risk, but bond market stress (Japan’s yield >2%, BoJ hike) signals global tightening fears.  \n- **News flow** highlights market unease: \"AI Spending Frenzy Sets Markets on Edge,\" Citadel’s weak gains, and oil supply growth.  \n\n**Verdict:** Bearish bias driven by macro pressures, options expiry volatility (\"Witching Day\"), and retail skepticism.\n\n---\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES  \n**A. Global Monetary Policy Tightening**  \n- BoJ hikes to 30-year high; Japan’s 10Y yield >2% (Reddit #1, #12).  \n- Fed Funds at 3.64% with persistent inflation—markets pricing in \"higher for longer.\"  \n\n**B. Fiscal & Debt Concerns**  \n- National debt ($38T) and $1T+ annual interest payments (Reddit #11).  \n- Intergenerational equity tensions (\"Stealing from Millennials/Gen Z\"—Reddit #15).  \n\n**C. Market Structure & Volatility**  \n- Record \"Witching Day\" (quadruple expiry) could amplify swings (Reddit #10).  \n- VIX elevated at 16.87; bond market volatility (Bloomberg: \"Bond Investors Untangle Data\").  \n\n**D. Sector-Specific Stress**  \n- **Tech**: AI spending frenzy causing uncertainty; Apple buyback criticism ($750B over 10Y).  \n- **Energy**: Saudi oil supply surge (Bloomberg #5) may pressure prices.  \n- **Gaming**: Hardware sales at 35-year low (Reddit #7).  \n\n**E. Data Integrity Skepticism**  \n- Housing inflation data questioned (\"assumes Zero Housing Inflation\"—Reddit #9).  \n- Retail distrust of media (\"fud warning\"—Reddit #3).  \n\n---\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n**Immediate Catalysts (Today):**  \n- **Options Expiry (\"Witching Day\")**: Expect elevated volatility, especially in meme stocks (GME mentioned) and indices.  \n- **Japan’s Yield Breakout**: May trigger capital flows from equities to bonds, strengthening JPY, pressuring risk assets.  \n\n**Medium-Term Signals:**  \n- **Yield Curve**: 10Y at 4.16% + BoJ hike = global liquidity drain.  \n- **Corporate Stress**: Citadel’s weak gains (Bloomberg #4) signal hedge fund pressure; FedEx overhaul (Bloomberg #8) shows cost-cutting amid slowing demand.  \n- **Commodities**: Oil supply rising (Saudi surge) vs. gold (GLD $399.88) holding as hedge.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Liquidity Crunch**: Global central bank tightening (BoJ, Fed) could accelerate equity outflows.  \n2. **Volatility Spike**: VIX + witching day + bond market confusion may trigger sharp downside moves.  \n3. **Debt Servicing**: $1T+ annual interest payments could force fiscal austerity, hurting growth.  \n4. **Retail Capitulation**: Reddit sentiment shows frustration; meme stock volatility (GME $406 reference) may indicate speculative froth unwinding.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \n1. **Defensive Hedges**: Gold (GLD) and long-duration Treasuries may benefit from flight-to-safety.  \n2. **Short Tech/AI Overextension**: AI spending frenzy cited as market risk (Bloomberg #1).  \n3. **Energy Shorts**: Rising oil supply (Saudi) could pressure prices if demand weakens.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**SECTOR INSIGHTS:**  \n- **FINANCIALS**: Monitor regional banks—rising yields may help NIM, but debt costs and commercial real estate exposure are risks.  \n- **TECH**: Caution on AI-heavy names; Apple (AAPL) buyback criticism signals shareholder pressure.  \n- **ENERGY**: Bearish bias—Saudi supply surge + slowing global demand = downside risk.  \n- **UTILITIES/REITS**: Avoid—rising rates pressure dividend yields.  \n\n**SYMBOL INSIGHTS:**  \n- **GLD**: Hold as hedge against volatility and debt concerns.  \n- **SOXS (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X)**: Consider for short-term hedge—tech spending anxiety + witching day volatility.  \n- **GME**: Extreme risk—Reddit mentions ($406 Google error) show speculative interest; avoid due to expiry-driven volatility.  \n- **FOLD (Amicus Therapeutics)**: Unusual mover (+30.49%); check for catalyst (news not in dataset)—potential biotech speculation.  \n\n**WATCH TODAY:**  \n1. **VIX > 18** = escalate hedges.  \n2. **10Y Yield > 4.25%** = reduce equity exposure.  \n3. **Quadruple witching volume spikes** in last hour—avoid new positions.  \n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**  \nThe market faces a confluence of macro headwinds (global tightening, debt, data distrust) and event-driven risks (witching day). Retail sentiment is defensive, while institutional news signals caution on AI and liquidity. **Tactical hedging and capital preservation are prioritized over risk-taking.** Watch bond yields and VIX for escalation signals.  \n\n**Next Update:** Monitor afternoon expiry flows and Japan yield reaction.",

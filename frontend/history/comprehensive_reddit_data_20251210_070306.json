The timing of the IPO could change based on market conditions and other factors, and one of the people said it could slip until 2027.\n\n&gt;SpaceX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n&gt;Media reports last week said the rocket-maker is kicking off a secondary share sale that would value it at $800 billion, pitting it against OpenAI for the title of the most valuable private company. However, Musk on Saturday dismissed the reports, calling them inaccurate.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/spacex-pursue-2026-ipo-raising-above-30-billion-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-12-09/",

Some said it’s a myth, others gave really vague answers that didn’t actually walk through the mechanics.\n\nI’ve been wondering about this for a long time too, especially the part about how they keep paying the interest without eventually getting squeezed. So today I sat down and built a simple spreadsheet, because I’m a visual learner, and this is what I came up with.\n\nImgur link for the Excel: https://imgur.com/a/jbzqQqD\n\n⸻\n\nLet’s assume a “rich guy” has $1,000,000 in a brokerage account. (Pretend $1M is “ultra rich” for this example – anything bigger gets hard for a normal person to visualize.)\n\nYear 1 He borrows $100,000 against his brokerage as collateral. He has good credit, so his interest rate is 4%. That year he owes $4,000 in interest. He sets aside the $4,000 and spends the remaining $96,000.\n\nEnd of Year 1: \n•\tAssets: $900,000 (since he borrowed $100k against the $1M) \n•\tDebt: $100,000 \n•\tNet worth: $900,000\n\nHe wants to maintain a lifestyle that costs around $100k a year in today’s dollars.\n\nNow factor in inflation. Let’s say inflation averages 3% per year. That means next year he needs a bit more than $100k to have the same lifestyle. In my example I used $106,800 just to stay in the ballpark.\n\nYear 2 \n•\tTotal debt so far = $100,000 (year 1) + $106,800 (year 2) = $206,800\n •\tInterest at 4% = $8,272\n •\tHe borrows $106,800, pays the $8,272 interest, and is left with $98,528 to spend\n\nThat’s still roughly within the $100k lifestyle range (adjusted for inflation), so he’s okay.\n\nHe keeps doing this every year: borrowing a bit more, covering the interest, and spending the rest. Fast-forward to Year 30 (he started at 30 years old, now he’s 60, or you can just treat it as 30 years later).\n\nYear 30 numbers from the sheet: \n•\tAmount borrowed that year: $545,928.10\n•\tTotal debt: $7,964,730.50 \n•\tInterest at 4%: $318,589.20\n•\tAfter paying interest, he has $227,338.90 left to spend\n\nBecause of inflation, that $227k is roughly equivalent to the original $100k lifestyle: \n•\t$100k in Year 1 ≈ $235,656.60 in Year 30 (with 3% inflation), so he’s still in the same lifestyle ballpark.\n\nMeanwhile: \n•\tBrokerage account has grown to: $9,317,275\n •\tTotal debt: $7,964,730.50 \n•\tNet worth: $1,352,544.50\n\nSo if he dies in Year 30, he can pay off all the debt and still leave about $1.35M in the account.\n\n⸻\n\nJust for fun I kept the model running out to Year 70. That’s someone who made their fortune at 30 and lived to 100.\n\nAt that point, using my assumptions: \n•\tBrokerage account: $202,413,339\n •\tTotal debt: $97,522,971.10 \n•\tAmount borrowed that year: $5,615,262.90 \n•\tInterest at 4%: $3,900,919\n•\tAfter interest, he has about $1,714,343.80 left to spend that year\n\nBy then, the original $100k lifestyle in Year 1 is equivalent to about $768,720.60 because of inflation, so he’s actually ahead of where he started in real terms. His net worth at that point is about $104,890,361.70.\n\nThis looks crazy, but remember: \n•\tI assumed his “borrowing need” grows 6% per year\n•Inflation is 3% \n•\tMarket returns are implicitly assumed to beat both over the long run\n\nBy around Year 30, his portfolio growth is outrunning both inflation and the interest, so the compounding really kicks in.\n\n⸻\n\nObviously, real life is not this smooth. Some years the market is up 15%, some years it’s down 20%. If you’re borrowing against your portfolio, you can’t run it this aggressively or you’ll get margin-called in a downturn. You have to stay more conservative on the loan-to-value ratio.\n\nBut the main point is: \n•\tYou don’t have to be “ultra rich” to understand or even use this concept. \n•\tThe math scales. Whether it’s $1M, $100k, or even $10k, the percentages work the same; the only difference is the dollar amounts.\n\nThe ultra rich just do this on a massive scale with better terms, better assets, and better risk management—but the basic “borrow against appreciated assets instead of selling and paying tax” idea is the same.",

      "content": "Global Bond Yields Hit 16-Year High on Fading Rate-Cut Bets\n\nGlobal bond markets flashed a warning signal ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Long-dated government bond yields have climbed to levels last seen in 2009, suggesting traders are starting to question whether the era of broad rate-cut cycles is actually ending. A Bloomberg index tracking long-term sovereign yields is now back at 16-year highs. Futures markets reflect that shift: expectations for additional cuts from the European Central Bank have essentially vanished, Japan is seen as almost certain to hike this month, and Australia is now priced for two more quarter-point increases next year. The move comes just as the Fed prepares to announce its next decision. While most investors still expect a cut on Wednesday, the broader message from global markets is that easing may not last as long or run as deep as previously hoped. Anyone else watching this tightening narrative re-emerge? Bond markets usually sniff out trends early, and this feels like a meaningful shift.\n\n\n\nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html)",

Investors seem to be reacting more to the cost outlook than to near-term earnings strength, with margins and future profitability now back in focus.\n\nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-stock-tumbles-over-4-after-company-warns-on-higher-spending-in-2026-195605298.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-stock-tumbles-over-4-after-company-warns-on-higher-spending-in-2026-195605298.html)",

      "content": "Mastercard (MA) broke into our Top 5 Quality Picks for the first time since August. Here's the breakdown.\n\nWe've been running a scoring algorithm on S&amp;P 500 stocks since August. Basically scores companies on fundamentals and how they stack up against sector peers, then runs them through some validation checks. Only 5 stocks make the cut each month.\n\nMastercard broke in for the first time at #5 on 1st December. The profitability on this thing is genuinely ridiculous. 196.9% return on equity, 45.3% net margins. Scored perfect marks on returns and margin efficiency. Analysts are bullish too: 49 of 62 have it as a Buy, with literally zero Sells, and the consensus implies about 21% upside.\n\nThe problem is valuation. Stockoscope DCF puts intrinsic value around $382  based on 12.9% growth for 5 years, followed by 5 years of tapering growth to 2%, discounted at 8.1% (and it's trading at $537 currently). That's a pretty big premium to pay, even for something this high quality. The growth would have to be around 20% for it to be fairly valued.  \n  \nTechnicals: Currently, it is down 11% from the highs, and there is a nice support  around the 500 levels, which would be around a 16% drop from the top. That would be a better entry than the current level, of course.\n\nCurious where others land on this. The quality is undeniable, but it's a bit pricey. \n\nNot financial advice. DYOR.",

WeRide received L4 driverless city permit in Abu Dhabi, outside of US. They turned their permits and reg approvals into real operating advantage. We can clearly see that WeRide is the first mover and leader in those countries. Working with Grab and Uber to operate their fleets gives them an access to huge target bases. Also, WeRide enters ADAS market, partnered with Bosch gives them more credibility in the auto market. \n\nInstitutional side: recently, ARK Invest purchased 858,295 shares of WeRide and extra 17,326 shares bia ARKQ. BofA, City and BOCI all applied a BUY rating on this stock, showing a long-term confidence in them. Their shareholders include: Fidelity, Greenwoods, Hudson Bay, Invesco, M&amp;G, Mirae Asset, Morgan Stanley IM, Temasek, and NVIDIA.\n\nThis is a super heavy capital industry and not cheap to operate. It's not realistic to expect them to have profits right away. However, when you look closely into their strategy, their partnerships and especially their Q3 performance, you can see the numbers have been improving quarter to quarter.

      "content": "Global Bond Yields Hit 16-Year High on Fading Rate-Cut Bets\n\nGlobal bond markets flashed a warning signal ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Long-dated government bond yields have climbed to levels last seen in 2009, suggesting traders are starting to question whether the era of broad rate-cut cycles is actually ending. A Bloomberg index tracking long-term sovereign yields is now back at 16-year highs. Futures markets reflect that shift: expectations for additional cuts from the European Central Bank have essentially vanished, Japan is seen as almost certain to hike this month, and Australia is now priced for two more quarter-point increases next year. The move comes just as the Fed prepares to announce its next decision. While most investors still expect a cut on Wednesday, the broader message from global markets is that easing may not last as long or run as deep as previously hoped. Anyone else watching this tightening narrative re-emerge? Bond markets usually sniff out trends early, and this feels like a meaningful shift.\n\n  \nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html)",

Here’s what to expect\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third straight meeting on Wednesday, but this one feels less straightforward than the last two. Inside the FOMC, there’s a clear split: some members want continued cuts to protect a cooling labor market, while others worry that easing too much could re-ignite inflation pressures. Beyond the rate decision itself, most of the focus will likely be on the updated dot plot and economic projections, which should give a better sense of how policymakers see the path forward. The cut looks likely, but the forward guidance may be doing most of the talking this time.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/the-fed-decision-is-expected-to-feature-a-rate-cut-and-a-lot-more-heres-what-to-expect.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

This represents a significant commitment, clearly signaling a long term dedication to deepening its presence in India.\n\nThis move appears to have dual implications for Amazon:\n\nPositives: India's e-commerce demand continues to grow rapidly. Large scale investment could accelerate Amazon's market share and logistics advantages locally. Long term, it may become a new growth engine.\n\nRisks: The massive investment and long return cycle, coupled with India's intense competition and complex regulations, may not necessarily translate into profits. The short term boost to stock prices could also be limited.\n\nI see this as a classic case of long term upside with short term uncertainty.\n\nDoes this news make you more optimistic about AMZN's long term value? If you're a shareholder, would you increase your position or remain cautious?",

We put about $85-100/month in the account. We mostly had used the account it for buying newborn things during pregnancy, ect.\n\nIs it worth it to open up a 529 account for her and put the money we have saved for her and the money per month in there? Is a simple investment account better and just put it in the S&amp;P 500? We live in Florida!",

      "content": "SpaceX IPO Plan Puts $2.9 Trillion of Listings Back On the Table\n\nThere’s growing talk that as much as $2.9 trillion worth of long-private companies could start moving toward the public markets, with SpaceX often mentioned as the potential trigger. That would also open the door for other massive centicorns companies valued at $100B+ in private markets that have stayed private for years. The big question is whether public investors will actually be willing to buy into businesses that often have limited profits, controversial leadership, and valuations that already price in years of perfection. It feels like a test not just for the IPO market, but for risk appetite across Wall Street as a whole.\n\n  \nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spacex-ipo-plan-puts-2-120000701.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spacex-ipo-plan-puts-2-120000701.html)",

The increase is being driven by tougher competition in the credit card business and heavier spending on artificial intelligence across the firm. The drop made JPMorgan the biggest loser in the Dow for the session and marked its worst one-day decline since early April.

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-10 07:02:11 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **BEARISH WITH SPECULATIVE POCKETS**\n- **Macro Sentiment:** Bearish. Stocks are slumping (Bloomberg) ahead of the Fed decision, with the VIX elevated at 16.93. The \"Forever Layoffs\" headline and slowing employment cost growth signal economic cooling and potential recessionary fears.\n- **Retail Sentiment (Reddit):** Defensive and fragmented. Dominated by macro anxiety (Fed uncertainty, geopolitical risks) and intense, isolated speculation around specific equities (GME). This is not broad bullish enthusiasm.\n- **Cross-Source Conclusion:** The prevailing mood is cautious and risk-off ahead of the Fed, with retail traders retreating to speculative, non-correlated plays (meme stocks, crypto) as a potential hedge against systemic uncertainty.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES\n- **Central Bank Policy & Macro Uncertainty:** The dominant theme. Fed rate decision trajectory, \"uncertain\" 2026 outlook (Reddit #1), and market slump in anticipation (RSS #2) are center stage.\n- **Geopolitical & Fiscal Risk:** Secondary but significant. Discussions of Europe potentially dumping U.S. Treasuries (Reddit #2) and Chevron/Venezuela talks (RSS #6) point to heightened geopolitical risk premia.\n- **Speculative Retail Mania (Isolated):** GameStop's earnings (Reddit #3,4,5) and crypto narratives (Reddit #9,10,11) show intense, community-driven activity decoupled from the broader bearish macro.\n- **Labor Market Deterioration:** A converging theme. \"Forever Layoffs\" (Reddit #14) aligns with the BLS release revision (Reddit #6) and the slowest employment cost growth in 4 years (RSS #7), painting a picture of a softening job market.\n\n## 3. CRITICAL MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n- **Immediate Catalyst (Today):** **Federal Reserve Decision & Powell Speech.** This is the overwhelming market focus. The third cut is priced in; the forward guidance (2026 dot plot) and Powell's tone will drive volatility.\n- **Geopolitical Signal:** The whisper of foreign official selling of U.S. debt (Reddit #2) is a **major but unconfirmed risk**. If credible, it could pressure Treasury prices (raise yields) and strengthen the dollar, conflicting with the Fed's easing path.\n- **Contrarian Sentiment Signal:** Extreme retail focus on GME during a broad market slump is a hallmark of a **\"bad breadth\" market**—speculation thrives while the core weakens. This often precedes or accompanies broader downturns.\n- **Economic Data Signal:** The Q3 Employment Cost Index (slowest in 4 years) is a critical inflation input for the Fed. It supports the dovish cut narrative but also hints at economic slowing.\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n- **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Policy Surprise Risk:** Fed delivers a hawkish cut or signals a pause, sparking an equity sell-off.\n    2.  **Geopolitical Liquidity Risk:** Any official confirmation of foreign Treasury selling could trigger a bond market tantrum.\n    3.  **Recession Acceleration Risk:** \"Forever Layoffs\" narrative gaining traction with weak data could shift focus from inflation to growth fears.\n- **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Dovish Fed Pivot Play:** A clearly dovish Fed could trigger a relief rally, especially in rate-sensitive sectors (tech, utilities).\n    2.  **Non-Correlated Speculation:** The intense retail focus on names like GME indicates capital seeking assets perceived as independent of macro drivers. This is high-risk but high-attention.\n    3.  **Defensive & Yield:** High dividend yield strategies (e.g., QYLD - RSS #8) are being highlighted as attractive in a lower-rate, volatile environment.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n**WATCH/DO:**\n\n- **SECTOR: Treasuries & Financials** – Watch for volatility and curve reaction post-Fed. A steepening curve (long yields rising faster on inflation/debt concerns) would pressure banks. A bullish flattening (on growth fears) would be a risk-off signal.\n- **SECTOR: Defense & Aerospace** – The $448M Palantir Navy deal (Reddit #7) underscores robust, policy-insensitive government spending. This sector offers a geopolitical and fiscal hedge.\n- **GME: High-Risk Speculative Momentum** – The retail narrative is overwhelmingly focused on positive fundamentals and perceived media neglect. **This is a pure sentiment/flow trade, not fundamental.** Expect extreme volatility. Watch for options flow and short interest data for timing. Not for risk-averse investors.\n- **GLD: Hedge Against Uncertainty** – Gold is elevated (~$386). The rally (RSS #1), geopolitical risks, and potential dollar volatility post-Fed support holding gold as a hedge. A hawkish Fed surprise is its primary near-term risk.\n- **SYMBOL: VIX / Volatility Products** – The VIX at ~17 with a major catalyst pending suggests the market is underpricing potential volatility. Watch for a spike above 20 on any surprise. Consider short-dated hedges.\n- **MACRO: U.S. Dollar (DXY)** – The key barometer of the Fed vs. Geopolitics tug-of-war. Dovish Fed = weaker USD. Geopolitical risk/ Treasury sell-off fear = stronger USD. Its direction will dictate moves across asset classes.\n\n---\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market is in a defensive crouch ahead of the Fed, with significant undercurrents of geopolitical and recession risk. Retail sentiment is bifurcated—macro fear is high, but capital is aggressively flowing into speculative pockets (GME, crypto) as an alternative. **The Fed's communication today will set the tone, but the structural risks (geopolitics, labor market) will not disappear.** Adopt a selective, hedged approach. Favor quality and non-correlation over broad index exposure in the near term.",

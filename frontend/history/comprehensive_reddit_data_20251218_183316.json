Trust me…I know. I’m in an absolute low right now and I pray that one day I can pullback. I managed to get a temporary extension for what is owed but I lost everything because I got lucky with liberation day, I made a lot because it and had plans to start my life with my girlfriend, she doesn’t know yet but each day I don’t tell her is killing me.\nI sold the house I grew up in, a burden I never wanted to deal with and I explicitly said I don’t want to worry about what is owed, I was naive enough to do my taxes on my own which came around liberation day and I genuinely did not expect to end the year like this.\nI made plans on paying my taxes several times and let it slip by and here I am.\nI wish a golden trade came my way and gave me a valuable life lesson and scare but I made my grave and I hope my girlfriend will forgive me.\nI have adhd and struggle with it daily, I chased the dopamine and panicked, fumbled hard.\nIf anything I wish to say please don’t do what I did, do not chase the dream because you’ll be left with a nightmare.\nIt’s so bad…",

Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22, 2026.\n\n&gt;“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” Chew said in the memo. Meanwhile, “TikTok global’s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing,” he wrote.\n\n&gt;The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September, which was pending approval from China. Chew’s memo does not mention China’s opinion on the transaction. It says 50% of the investors will be new, with Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment company, retaining 15% each; 30.1% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance.\n\n&gt;After more than a year of negotiations, Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance’s popular video app to a consortium of investors. If finalized, the deal would remove a persistent issue in Beijing-Washington relations and signal progress in broader talks. But it would also deprive China’s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon.\n\n&gt;ByteDance’s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok’s business. Under the the deal proposed by Washington, ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity, which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle, TikTok’s cloud partner.\n\n&gt;Trump’s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know?: QuickTake\n\n&gt;The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement, which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration. US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app’s recommendation algorithm.\n\n&gt;Under the law, the initial deadline for the sell-or-ban rule was this past January, but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office, most recently pushing it into January 2026.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bes8jzkrv18g1.png?width=1587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f406b925304f2c0ce50176783172b3016adb28fc\n\n",

      "content": "Vitalik Buterin Warns Elon Musk That X's Hate Campaigns Could Hurt Free Speech\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed issues to Elon Musk, arguing that the recent surge of \"unhinged\" hate speech and coordinated attacks against Europe on X (formerly Twitter) is jeopardizing the very future of free speech. Following a €120 million fine imposed on X by the European Commission for Digital Services Act violations—including issues with the paid verification system and lack of transparency—Buterin observed that discourse on the platform has shifted from policy debate to \"emotionally-manipulative misinformation.\"\n\nButerin expressed concern that Musk has turned the platform into a \"death star laser for coordinated hate sessions,\" specifically targeting European cities like London and delegitizing the EU. He argues that this behavior risks a massive global backlash against liberal values in the coming years. While acknowledging valid criticisms of EU bureaucracy and surveillance, Buterin maintains that X’s current trajectory—where algorithms are \"arbitrarily\" tweaked to boost rage over civility—is a structural risk to democratic values.\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin proposed two primary solutions:\n\n* Algorithmic Transparency: Disclosing optimization targets so users understand what the platform is promoting and why.\n* On-Chain Verification: Using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and time-stamping decisions on-chain to make the algorithm more transparent and less susceptible to manual manipulation or censorship.\n\nUltimately, Buterin views the survival of a unified, reformed Europe as a vital global model and fears that Musk’s \"personal vendetta\" against EU regulators is weaponizing the platform in a way that will eventually lead to the destruction of the free speech principles Musk claims to defend.",

      "content": "Insights From Analyzing 10+ Stocks in the Energy Sector\n\nA few weeks ago I saw an interesting post here about the [energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pbgprq/energy_stocks_are_still_cheap_and_nobody_seems_to/) sector. The basic idea was straightforward:\n\nThere is an unprecedented amount of data center capacity planned over the next five years, and data centers are extreme power consumers. In the U.S., a large share of power generation still comes from hydrocarbons, especially natural gas. Companies that provide that energy appear to be overlooked.\n\nWhat that post didn’t get into was a deeper dive into the energy companies themselves — specifically, which ones might actually offer attractive opportunities today.\n\nSo I decided to do that. I used a tool I built that ingests SEC filings for each company and supplements them with industry data from:\n\n* American Petroleum Institute\n* U.S. Energy Information Administration\n* American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers\n* Society of Petroleum Engineers\n* Journal of Petroleum Technology\n* World Oil\n* Oil and Gas Journal\n* Hydrocarbon Processing\n\nI produced 10+ reports across different energy companies. After going through all of them, the companies that stood out to me were:\n\n* [Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/BjArBLK0WHRj) – this was the most interesting to me given that it generated \\~$8.1B of TTM free cash flow in 2024 on a \\~$73B market cap (a mid-teens FCF yield if sustained), while the stock is roughly flat over the past 12 months (+0.9%). It trades at \\~7x EV/EBITDA and \\~12x TTM EPS, despite controlling \\~20.1B boe of long-life 2P oil sands reserves and producing \\~1.36M boe/d. The valuation appears to reflect market skepticism around long-duration durability and Canadian policy risk more than near-term cash generation.\n* [Matador Resources (MTDR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/eXS9JPBjEbOK) – MTDR stood out because balance-sheet stress is not evident in the current numbers: net debt sits below \\~1x EBITDA, production continues to grow in the Delaware Basin, and the company owns majority-interest, largely fee-based midstream assets (San Mateo / Pronto) that support cash-flow stability. Despite this, the stock trades around \\~3x EV/EBITDA, a multiple more commonly associated with higher leverage or structurally challenged E&amp;Ps.\n* [Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/YDjQ0bF0lQjM) – In contrast to the commodity-exposed producers, EPD’s appeal is the consistency of its cash generation: operating cash flow has stayed above \\~$7.5B annually since 2021, distribution coverage has run \\~1.6–1.7x, and the partnership retained \\~$3.24B in 2024 after distributions. Units trade around \\~7.5x EV/EBITDA despite this level of cash-flow stability and balance-sheet strength.\n\nI’m also sharing the reports for the other companies I analyzed in case anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [CHEVRON CORP (CVX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/dPtgVsyaOVZt)\n* [ANTERO RESOURCES Corp (AR)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/IDhlgnNAdAUB)\n* [AEMETIS, INC (AMTX)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/qWCT1bsvIyDj)\n* [NextDecade Corp (NEXT)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/JJZlaAD3JrFK)\n* [AMEREN CORP (AEE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/bz6cvzIIw5KP)\n* [SM Energy Co (SM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/2rQK36fGNwaD)\n* [Crescent Energy Co (CRGY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/DDSGWbDUlote)\n* [EXXON MOBIL CORP (XOM)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/p9Lzg0rb1qKZ)\n* [OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP (OXY)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/8ZSEPD2k7oDk)\n* [Vital Energy, Inc. (VTLE)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/sYfs8N4YJHVR)\n* [WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC. (WMB)](https://app.deepvalue.tech/report-share/z2j2kNtxUEXR)\n\nCusious to hear which energy stocks others here are following. Any interesting ones I missed?",

Today’s Executive Order (Dec 18, 2025) to move the sector to Schedule III changes that by removing IRS Section 280E.\n\nUnder 280E, these companies were taxed on gross revenue because they couldn't deduct rent or payroll. This led to effective tax rates of 70-90%. By moving to a standard 21% corporate rate, the \"top tier\" of the $MSOS ETF will see profits increase exponentially.\n\nFurthermore, recent federal legislation just effectively banned 95% of hemp-derived THC competition (gas station Delta-8/9).

That seems fairly straightforward to analyze - what is the total payment volume, how is it growing, and what is the take rate. Okay. \n \nBut the other part of the financial arms is extending consumer credit. They extend loans to consumers, to buy things on the platform, and have to hold some provisions for losses for these. \n \nThis is more like a banking operation. But unlike a bank, you can’t really disentangle the lending operations from the e-commerce part of the business - since the credit is fuelling purchases on the platform. And you can’t really pull out the balance sheets of these operations to analyze for financial soundness. Finally, we don’t really have great historical analogues for consumer credit cycles in these emerging markets like Latin America and Southeast Asia. \n \nFor investors in these companies, how do you analyze the lending divisions of these companies?

I keep seeing lists for the \"best growth stocks 2026\" but they all just seem to list the same mega cap tech companies.\n\nI'm not afraid of some risk, but I also don't want to just chase what's already shot up. I'm interested in sectors that might be overlooked now but have solid long term potential.\n\nHow do you even begin to research a company for a 3-5 year time horizon instead of just quarterly earnings?  \nAre there sectors you think are undervalued right now that could be strong contenders for the best growth stocks 2026?  \nHow much does current Fed policy and interest rates play into your long term stock picks?\n\nI'm not looking for specific tickers, more like a framework for how to think about this.

While the headlines focus on falling obesity rates, there isnt evidence to show that real world kidney disease incidence is dropping. Perhaps the drugs cause too much muscle loss, or maybe people are just not staying on them long enough. Real-world data shows nearly 60% of users quit within a year, and obesity remains pervasive amonst Gen Z. \n\nDVA is trades at a forward P/E of 9.4, which is a significant discount to its historical 5 year average. When you consider they just authorized another $2 billion in buybacks, you’re looking at a company that is aggressively cannibalizing its own cheap shares.\n\n​The real long term story here is DaVita’s shift toward integrated kidney care and their massive international expansion. They’ve quietly built a footprint of over 580 centers in 14 countries, effectively diversifying away from U.S. regulatory risk and capturing growth in markets like Brazil and Japan where dialysis demand is booming.  They are also moving 100% of their centers to the Epic EHR platform to modernize billing and prevent caims lag that was seem after the April cyber incident. Plus, the pivot toward home dialysis (now 15% of their patient base) is a double win: it’s preferred by patients and significantly reduces the expensive nurse-to-patient labor ratios that have squeezed margins recently. With a trailing EBITDA of roughly $2.7 billion and a dominant market position, DVA isn't a dying business.\n\nAs the market pivots away from tech, I think now might be the right time to start buying into DVA. I see it as a premier, low beta, defense play providing a recession resistant business model. Sentiment surrounding this stock has been very negative creating an opportunity for us value-minded individuals.\n\nLet me know what you guys think.",

Also Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and  the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders.\n\n Tesla’s SEC filings show that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market.\n\n Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution.\n\n Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards.\n\nTesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels.  Absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.\n\nThis is my follow up post to my previous post on the same space which got deleted bcoz I didn't do any detailed analysis.Here you have it",

I learn a lot on the process (2.5 years), I am super proud of the skills that I am having and growing with time (money is not growing as fast but work-&gt;skill-&gt;money so I am patient). But...\n\nI am afraid, afraid because I am not giving enough time to cybersecurity, which I feel like ill regret it if my clothing brand don't work or idk. But i feel lost between the 2 but the thing I love the 2. And I am not totally able to focus on my clothing brand because I have a working visa that is related to my cyber security contract (I am employed on a company), so I must have a main job, and I know in a couple of years if my clothing brand do not work, ill open my own cybersec company.\n\nBut idk I am lost between both, I know aiming huge money on a clothing brand takes years or a decade, at the same time I love tech. So I am lost...\n\nCan someone give me advice ? Maybe there is some pov that I don't see and you do !",

But I had an issue when I tried to sign up for a checking account. Their system for uploading documents to verify identities and addresses is glitched evidently. This wouldn't be a dealbreaker by itself. Technical issues happen. But I went through a feedback loop with customer service for weeks and have nothing to show for it. It was easily the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I can't trust such an entity with my money.\n\nSo, I'm looking for alternatives. I like the concept of Acorns. I would just like to find a similar brokerage firm that can actually help me with technical issues if/when they occur.\n\nAnyone have any recommendations based on your personal experiences? Thanks!",

I mean the companies that produce the power, not the companies that buy it and sell it to consumers. \n\nFrom where I sit, Texas is the number one destination for these huge power hungry AI data centers.  There are by my calculations exactly 0 new power plants being built, for the most part the power companies are focusing on making them more efficient or expanding some but shovels breaking ground on new is zero and its been zero since Biden passed the build back act.  \n\nIn my opinion there is a pretty clear reasons why none have gotten off the ground, they have long build times and there are countless ways that they can be derailed.  \n\nThe reason for Texas is that they have a unique power grid that allows for open market bidding on power and its not meaningfully connected to the eastern or western part of the US grid.    \n\nIf my thesis is correct that data centers will require a huge amount of power, can be put up very quickly, have vast resources to bid on the open market and no new power sources are coming online for at least 10 years, the premium that the producers of power in Texas will be able to charge is going to go up significantly.

      "content": "Not overreacting to the NVDA insider sale\n\nNvidia director Harvey Jones sold about 250,000 shares around $177 for roughly $44M. These were shares he’s held for decades, and he still controls over 7M shares through a trust, so I read this as long term trimming more than a confidence signal turning negative. (News source if you’re interested: Nvidia Executives Sell Over $41 Million in Stock)For me, the headline only matters if it lines up with the chart. NVDA is in a pretty defined zone and the $177 to $180 area is the near term pivot. That’s roughly where the sale happened, and it has also been a tough area for the stock to push through lately. If NVDA can reclaim $180 and stay above it for a few closes, it’s basically the market saying it does not care about the insider headline.On the downside, I’m watching $169 to $171 as first support. If that breaks cleanly, the next likely stop is the mid $160s, around $165 to $160. Below that, you’re probably looking at the low $150s, and that usually needs a broader market wobble or a real shift in the AI narrative. This is also why I’m not overreacting to the insider sale by itself. Big, long held positions get trimmed all the time. Without a real break in price or a clear change in demand signals, it’s not enough for me to call a top.",

Deadlines start slipping. A team that used to be fast suddenly moves slower.  \nBudgets stretch further than expected. Meetings multiply without producing decisions. Leaders start sensing friction but theyre not sure where it’s coming from. Is it workload imbalance?  A manager overwhelmed? A team operating without clarity? Resources being allocated the wrong way? Or something deeper, like burnout creeping through an entire department? The truth is inefficiency rarely announces itself. It builds quietly, hidden inside tools, systems, and processes that no one has time to examine. By the time the symptoms are loud enough for executives to notice, the problem has already become expensive. HR is expected to diagnose these issues yet theyre asked to do it without the one thing that would make it possible: connected, clear data. You cant fix what you cant see and most inefficiencies stay invisible far longer than they should and HR AI solutions are needed!!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORT**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-18 18:32:06 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC WITH HIGH RETAIL SKEPTICISM**\n*   **Overall Sentiment:** **Neutral to Slightly Bullish** for institutional/professional markets, but **Highly Skeptical & Volatile** in retail circles.\n*   **Professional Sentiment (RSS News):** Bullish bias. The market is reacting positively to a key inflation beat (\"Stocks Rise on CPI Inflation Beat\"), suggesting institutional money is flowing in on the macro data.\n*   **Retail Sentiment (Reddit):** Deeply skeptical and fragmented. While some celebrate profits (#10), dominant themes are distrust of official data (#7, #9, #15), political rhetoric vs. reality (#1, #2, #15), and high-risk trading blow-ups (#5). The surge in Trump Media (DJT) (#6, #8, #11) is a notable retail frenzy, but it's isolated and characteristic of meme-stock speculation, not broad market conviction.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES**\n*   **Inflation Narrative & Data Disconnect:** This is the **dominant theme**. Official CPI data shows a decline to 2.7% (Macro Data, Reddit #9, #13), which is being treated as a positive catalyst by institutions (RSS #9). However, a significant portion of the retail base expresses deep skepticism about the data's validity (Reddit #7, #15) and contrasts it with perceived real-world price pressures (Reddit #2).\n*   **Political & Policy Impact:** Trade/tariff policies (Reddit #1, RSS #3 on Toyota) and political commentary on the economy are heavily discussed, creating a noisy backdrop that influences retail sentiment more than institutional positioning.\n*   **Corporate Actions & Specific Catalysts:**\n    *   **Merger Mania (Speculative):** The $6B Trump Media (DJT) and TAE Technologies merger is a major retail-focused event, likely driving volatile, sentiment-based trading.\n    *   **Corporate Resilience:** Positive earnings/guidance from bellwethers like FedEx (RSS #2) and Nike (despite challenges, RSS #1) point to underlying economic strength.\n    *   **Global IPO Heat:** Strong focus on India's capital markets (RSS #4, #6) as a destination for global growth capital.\n*   **Risk Management & Consequences:** Reddit is rife with cautionary tales of leverage and loss (#5), highlighting the persistent risk-taking and potential for sudden, severe drawdowns in retail portfolios.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Primary Catalyst (Confirmed):** **The CPI print of 2.7%** is the clear driver for the day's institutional bullish move. It supports a \"soft landing\" narrative and eases pressure on the Fed (Fed Funds at 3.64%, 10Y Yield at 4.16%).\n*   **Key Signal:** The **VIX at 17.62** is elevated but not spiking, suggesting options markets are pricing in ongoing uncertainty but not immediate panic. Combined with a positive reaction to CPI, this indicates a market that is cautiously absorbing good news.\n*   **Contrarian Signal:** The extreme retail skepticism of the same CPI data that institutions are buying presents a **sentiment divergence**. This can be a fuel for further gains if the data is validated over time, as \"doubters\" may be forced to chase.\n*   **Technical/Momentum Signal:** **NVDA's gain (+1.87%)** leading the FMP snapshot indicates healthy risk appetite in the crucial tech/AI sector, supporting the broader bullish move.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Sentiment Shock:** If subsequent data contradicts the benign inflation story, the market is vulnerable to a sharp reversal. Retail skepticism could turn into a self-fulfilling panic on bad news.\n    2.  **Speculative Excess:** The parabolic move in stocks like DJT and the focus on high-risk options (Reddit #5) are signs of froth in pockets of the market, which can unwind violently.\n    3.  **Geopolitical/Policy Uncertainty:** Trade policy headlines (RSS #3) and political economic claims (Reddit #1, #2) remain an overhang that could disrupt specific sectors (e.g., autos, manufacturing).\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Follow-Through on Inflation Trend:** A sustained downtrend in inflation allows the Fed to remain on hold or even consider cuts earlier than expected, benefiting rate-sensitive sectors and growth stocks.\n    2.  **Stock Picking in Resilient Sectors:** Companies like FedEx (FDX) demonstrating strong execution in a moderating economy offer alpha opportunities.\n    3.  **International Diversification:** The booming Indian IPO market (RSS #4) represents a high-growth alternative to mature US markets.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n*   **SECTOR: Financials (Banks & Brokers)** - Watch for strength as the yield curve potentially steepens on a stable Fed outlook. The confirmation of key regulators (RSS #5) also reduces political uncertainty for the sector.\n*   **SECTOR: Industrials & Logistics** - Positive guidance from FedEx (FDX) is a leading indicator for economic activity. Consider related names in transportation and logistics.\n*   **SYMBOL: DJT / Trump Media & Technology Group** - **Extreme Caution.** The merger news has sparked a classic retail-driven short squeeze/speculative surge. This is a high-risk, sentiment-driven trade, not a fundamental investment. Watch for extreme volatility and prepare for a sharp pullback.\n*   **SYMBOL: NVDA** - Its leadership on a macro-data day is a **strong bullish signal** for the tech sector. A break above recent resistance could signal a broader \"risk-on\" rally. Monitor for continuation.\n*   **ASSET CLASS: International Equities (India Focus)** - Allocate research resources to Indian markets (e.g., via ETFs like INDA or FLIN) or the upcoming IPO pipeline. Global capital flows are evident (RSS #4, #6).\n*   **ACTION: Hedge Volatility** - With VIX elevated and sentiment fractured, consider maintaining modest portfolio hedges (e.g., via VIX calls or put spreads on indices) while maintaining core long positions. The path higher is likely to be choppy.\n*   **WATCH: Next Inflation Data Points (PCE, CPI Revisions)** - The credibility of the disinflation narrative is now the primary market driver. Any significant upside surprise will likely trigger a severe correction given current positioning.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is tentatively embracing a \"soft landing\" narrative post-CPI, but this thesis rests on shaky retail confidence. **Trade with the institutional flow (cautiously bullish) but be acutely aware of the speculative froth and data skepticism prevalent among retail traders, which can amplify downside moves.** Prioritize quality companies with strong guidance and monitor the inflation trajectory above all else.",

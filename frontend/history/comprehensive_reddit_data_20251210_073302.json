The timing of the IPO could change based on market conditions and other factors, and one of the people said it could slip until 2027.\n\n&gt;SpaceX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n&gt;Media reports last week said the rocket-maker is kicking off a secondary share sale that would value it at $800 billion, pitting it against OpenAI for the title of the most valuable private company. However, Musk on Saturday dismissed the reports, calling them inaccurate.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/spacex-pursue-2026-ipo-raising-above-30-billion-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-12-09/",

      "content": "Global Bond Yields Hit 16-Year High on Fading Rate-Cut Bets\n\nGlobal bond markets flashed a warning signal ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Long-dated government bond yields have climbed to levels last seen in 2009, suggesting traders are starting to question whether the era of broad rate-cut cycles is actually ending. A Bloomberg index tracking long-term sovereign yields is now back at 16-year highs. Futures markets reflect that shift: expectations for additional cuts from the European Central Bank have essentially vanished, Japan is seen as almost certain to hike this month, and Australia is now priced for two more quarter-point increases next year. The move comes just as the Fed prepares to announce its next decision. While most investors still expect a cut on Wednesday, the broader message from global markets is that easing may not last as long or run as deep as previously hoped. Anyone else watching this tightening narrative re-emerge? Bond markets usually sniff out trends early, and this feels like a meaningful shift.\n\n\n\nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html)",

      "content": "Mastercard (MA) broke into our Top 5 Quality Picks for the first time since August. Here's the breakdown.\n\nWe've been running a scoring algorithm on S&amp;P 500 stocks since August. Basically scores companies on fundamentals and how they stack up against sector peers, then runs them through some validation checks. Only 5 stocks make the cut each month.\n\nMastercard broke in for the first time at #5 on 1st December. The profitability on this thing is genuinely ridiculous. 196.9% return on equity, 45.3% net margins. Scored perfect marks on returns and margin efficiency. Analysts are bullish too: 49 of 62 have it as a Buy, with literally zero Sells, and the consensus implies about 21% upside.\n\nThe problem is valuation. Stockoscope DCF puts intrinsic value around $382  based on 12.9% growth for 5 years, followed by 5 years of tapering growth to 2%, discounted at 8.1% (and it's trading at $537 currently). That's a pretty big premium to pay, even for something this high quality. The growth would have to be around 20% for it to be fairly valued.  \n  \nTechnicals: Currently, it is down 11% from the highs, and there is a nice support  around the 500 levels, which would be around a 16% drop from the top. That would be a better entry than the current level, of course.\n\nCurious where others land on this. The quality is undeniable, but it's a bit pricey. \n\nNot financial advice. DYOR.",

(Fundamentals + 10-year durability)\n\n1. They have a near-monopoly on critical technology\nASML is the only company in the world capable of making EUV lithography machines, which are required to produce advanced chips (3nm, 2nm, future nodes).\nThis is the definition of an irreplaceable moat.\nNo EUV machines, no AI chips, no Nvidia, no smartphones, no cars, no defence systems.\nThis is real pricing power.\n\n2. Massive demand for chips for the next decade.\nTrends that structurally depend on ASML:\nAI chips, Cloud computing, Autonomous driving, da centers\nDefence/space, Robotics, Medical devices, Consumer electronics, Solar &amp; battery tech, National chip-sovereignty expansion (US, EU, China, Japan, India)\nEveryone wants to build fabs and every fab needs ASML machines.\n\n3. Backlog is so large they can’t even meet demand\nChip manufacturers wait years for ASML equipment.\nThat’s how strong their order book is.\nHigh backlog = stable revenue visibility = long-term compounding.\n\n4. Margins are exceptional\nGross margins often above 50%\nDominant share of system revenue + services (recurring, high-margin)\n\n5. Governments will never let ASML die: US, EU, Japan, South Korea all depend on them.\nThey're considered a strategic asset for national security.\nGeopolitical risk actually strengthens their position.\n\n6. They raise prices every year\nWhen you’re the only supplier, price elasticity is unlimited.\nMachines cost $150M–$350M+ each — and they sell more every year.\n\n7. 10-year CAGR potential\nRealistic expectations:\nRevenue CAGR 12–18%\nEarnings CAGR 15–22%\nPotential 10-year total return: 3x–6x\nPotential upside if AI demand explodes: 8x–10x\n\nWhat’s your pick and why?",

On the face of it, a 40% downward guidance revision would justify a 40-50% price drop\n* The break down of EPS revision and remediation are indicated below. The drivers of downward revision are all due to higher MCR (at a high-level0\n\n|Segment|EPS Guidance Initial vs Current|Remediation|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||\n|Marketplace|\\+3 vs -2|Increase 2026 premiums 15–45% (avg \\~30%).

I would assume $100B/year. Annual spend is $800B so not substantial. I would expect MOH revenue to be impacted adversely by 13-15%. \n* This checks out with management commentary that they are more concerned about premiums as opposed to membership\n* In the worst case scenario I would expect revenues to drop by 14-15%\n   * This is the absolute worst case. In all probability a federal revenue cut will be compensated by state funds\n\n**Stock Price**\n\nI should do a DCF instead of using a lazy multiplier, but I wanted to get a quick sense check from the community before I spend more time so please bear with me.\n\n|Segment|Best Case|Average Case|Worst Case|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Marketplace (ACA)|3|2|0|\n|Medicare|0|0|0|\n|Medicaid|19|17|15|\n|Total|22|19|15|\n|Stock Price (PE of 15)|330|285|225|\n\nEven in the worst case I see a price of 225.

WeRide received L4 driverless city permit in Abu Dhabi, outside of US. They turned their permits and reg approvals into real operating advantage. We can clearly see that WeRide is the first mover and leader in those countries. Working with Grab and Uber to operate their fleets gives them an access to huge target bases. Also, WeRide enters ADAS market, partnered with Bosch gives them more credibility in the auto market. \n\nInstitutional side: recently, ARK Invest purchased 858,295 shares of WeRide and extra 17,326 shares bia ARKQ. BofA, City and BOCI all applied a BUY rating on this stock, showing a long-term confidence in them. Their shareholders include: Fidelity, Greenwoods, Hudson Bay, Invesco, M&amp;G, Mirae Asset, Morgan Stanley IM, Temasek, and NVIDIA.\n\nThis is a super heavy capital industry and not cheap to operate. It's not realistic to expect them to have profits right away. However, when you look closely into their strategy, their partnerships and especially their Q3 performance, you can see the numbers have been improving quarter to quarter. Imo, this company is having a huge potential in the whole auto space in the next few years, they doing the real things instead of saying and doing nothing on press.",

      "content": "529 or different account for new baby?\n\nHi all! Wife and I had our first kid 7 months ago. We already have around $4k for her just sitting in a high yield savings. We put about $85-100/month in the account. We mostly had used the account it for buying newborn things during pregnancy, ect.\n\nIs it worth it to open up a 529 account for her and put the money we have saved for her and the money per month in there? Is a simple investment account better and just put it in the S&amp;P 500? We live in Florida!",

The increase is being driven by tougher competition in the credit card business and heavier spending on artificial intelligence across the firm. The drop made JPMorgan the biggest loser in the Dow for the session and marked its worst one-day decline since early April. Investors seem to be reacting more to the cost outlook than to near-term earnings strength, with margins and future profitability now back in focus.\n\nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-stock-tumbles-over-4-after-company-warns-on-higher-spending-in-2026-195605298.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-stock-tumbles-over-4-after-company-warns-on-higher-spending-in-2026-195605298.html)",

This represents a significant commitment, clearly signaling a long term dedication to deepening its presence in India.\n\nThis move appears to have dual implications for Amazon:\n\nPositives: India's e-commerce demand continues to grow rapidly. Large scale investment could accelerate Amazon's market share and logistics advantages locally. Long term, it may become a new growth engine.\n\nRisks: The massive investment and long return cycle, coupled with India's intense competition and complex regulations, may not necessarily translate into profits. The short term boost to stock prices could also be limited.\n\nI see this as a classic case of long term upside with short term uncertainty.\n\nDoes this news make you more optimistic about AMZN's long term value? If you're a shareholder, would you increase your position or remain cautious?",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-10 07:32:10 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n### 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **BEARISH with Elevated Anxiety**\nThe data points to a negative short-term sentiment driven by macro uncertainty and retail disillusionment.\n*   **Reddit Sentiment:** Dominated by fear and skepticism. Key phrases like \"this market feels fake,\" discussion of \"forever layoffs,\" and political risk (Europe dumping U.S. debt) indicate a fraying retail nerve. The intense focus on GameStop (GME) earnings suggests a retreat into meme-stock narratives, often a contrarian indicator of broader market stress.\n*   **News Flow:** Headlines confirm the negative tone (\"Stocks Slump as Wall Street Awaits Fed Decision\").\n*   **Technical/Macro Data:** A VIX of 16.93 is elevated, signaling increased fear. The 10Y Treasury Yield at 4.17% remains high, pressuring equity valuations. The market is in a classic \"risk-off\" posture ahead of a key Fed catalyst.\n\n### 2. KEY THEMES:\n*   **Federal Reserve & Macro Uncertainty:** The paramount theme. The market is on hold awaiting the Fed's decision and Powell's guidance. The debate centers on the sustainability of the rate-cut cycle (Reddit #1) amidst high yields and persistent inflation (CPI: 324.368).\n*   **Geopolitical & Fiscal Risk:** Unusual prominence of a potential sovereign debt threat (Reddit #2: Europe dumping U.S. Treasuries). Combined with news of a U.S. government funding lapse affecting BLS data (Reddit #5), this introduces a layer of systemic and data-integrity risk.\n*   **Retail Disillusionment & Meme Stock Resurgence:** A clear bifurcation. Broad retail sentiment is turning negative (\"sold everything\"), while concentrated, high-engagement activity returns to 2021-era meme stocks (GME, Nextdoor via Bloomberg News #1). This is a **warning sign** of speculative, last-stand behavior.\n*   **AI & Defense Tech Momentum:** Positive thematic tailwinds continue, evidenced by Palantir's major Navy contract (Reddit #6) and perennial interest in NVIDIA (News #8).\n*   **Crypto Volatility & Institutionalization:** Contradictory signals: viral regret stories (Reddit #9) vs. institutional adoption (Texas Bitcoin reserve - Reddit #10). Indicates a sector in a volatile, maturing phase.\n\n### 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS:\n*   **Immediate Catalyst (Today):** **Federal Reserve Decision & Powell Press Conference.** This will dictate the near-term direction for rates, the dollar, and equity multiples.\n*   **Negative Signal:** The surge in discussions about **layoffs** (\"Forever Layoffs\" hitting a trigger) and **retail capitulation** (\"sold everything\") is a classic sentiment washout signal, often preceding a bounce but confirming current weakness.\n*   **Contrarian Speculative Signal:** The coordinated push around **GameStop's earnings** by low-credibility accounts suggests a potential \"pump\" event. The Bloomberg report on **Nextdoor (KIND)** experiencing a \"meme rally\" confirms this speculative pattern is active beyond GME.\n*   **Liquidity Signal:** Announcements of massive future IPOs (SpaceX in 2026) and a strong 2025 for IPOs in Stockholm signal long-term capital market appetite but also future equity supply that could drain liquidity.\n\n### 4. RISK ASSESSMENT:\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Fed Hawkish Surprise:** The biggest near-term risk. If the Fed signals a pause or slower pace for 2025 cuts, it could trigger a sharp sell-off.\n    2.  **Geopolitical Debt Shock:** While low probability, the threat of foreign selling of U.S. debt is a nuclear scenario for bond markets and the dollar.\n    3.  **Earnings Deterioration:** The \"forever layoffs\" theme and Larry Cheng's \"Bottom line > Top line\" quote (Reddit #11) point to intense cost-cutting pressure, a sign of underlying profit margin stress.\n    4.  **Retail Liquidation:** If the \"sold everything\" sentiment spreads, it could accelerate a downward move.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Fed Dovish Relief Rally:** Any confirmation of a sustained easing path could spark a broad-based rally, especially in rate-sensitive sectors.\n    2.  **Thematic Strength in Defense/AI:** Companies like **Palantir (PLTR)** are demonstrating tangible, large-scale government contracts, providing fundamental insulation.\n    3.  **Sentiment Extremes:** Excessive fear (high VIX, capitulation posts) often creates tactical buying opportunities in high-quality, oversold names.\n\n### 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:\n*   **SECTOR: Financials & Treasuries - WATCH.** The entire market hinges on the Fed. Be prepared for volatility in banks (KRE) and bond ETFs (TLT). A hawkish tilt is a clear sell signal for these sectors.\n*   **SECTOR: Defense/AI - MONITOR FOR STRENGTH.** The PLTR contract is a significant fundamental catalyst. Look for strength in related names (e.g., RTX, LDOS, other AI-enabled gov contractors) as a potential safe-haven trade if the broader market sells off.\n*   **KIND / GME: EXTREME CAUTION.** The identified meme-stock pattern is high-risk. These are liquidity-driven pumps, not fundamental moves. Retail is being weaponized. Avoid or use strict risk controls.\n*   **VIX: HEDGE.** With the VIX elevated and a binary event (Fed) pending, long-volatility strategies (e.g., VIX calls, put spreads on indices) are prudent for portfolio protection.\n*   **ACTION: RAISE CASH / REDUCE BETA.** The pre-Fed slump, negative sentiment, and elevated risks justify a defensive posture. Reduce exposure to high-beta, unprofitable tech and increase cash to deploy after the Fed clarity causes volatility to settle.\n*   **MACRO: WATCH THE DOLLAR (DXY) & 10Y YIELD.** A spike in the 10Y yield above 4.25% or a sharp dollar rally post-Fed would be strongly negative for risk assets. Conversely, a drop in yield would be a buy signal.\n\n---\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market is in a defensive, risk-off holding pattern ahead of the Fed. Retail sentiment has turned bearish, with fear manifesting in both capitulation and reckless meme-stock speculation. **The Fed's message today is the critical inflection point.** Until then, prioritize capital preservation, hedge for volatility, and avoid chasing speculative retail frenzies. Opportunities will emerge after the macro fog clears.",

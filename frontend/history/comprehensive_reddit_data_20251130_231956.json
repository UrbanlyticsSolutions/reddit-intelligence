      "content": "Seasonal hiring down 25% from last year as layoffs rise and retailers stay cautious amid weak consumer spending\n\nNote: \"Weak consumer spending\" refers to store expectations before the season started. Consumer spending ended up being high which is why Black Friday set a new record\n\nNo paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seasonal-hiring-offers-little-reprieve-for-labor-market-woes-110044972.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seasonal-hiring-offers-little-reprieve-for-labor-market-woes-110044972.html)\n\n&gt;Plenty of Americans are expected to pour into stores and fill online carts this holiday shopping season. Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza.\n\n&gt;As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up, the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year, with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade.\n\n&gt;Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012.\n\n&gt;The National Retail Federation, a trade group, also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season, plans to bring on extra staff could be at “the lowest level in more than 15 years.” Retailers were expected to bring on 265,000 to 365,000 seasonal workers, compared to 442,000 in 2024.\n\n&gt;Interest in seasonal work, though, remains plenty high — up 27% at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board, according to Cory Stahle, a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab.\n\n&gt;Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7% from a year ago, and still below pre-pandemic levels. (Indeed’s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall, such as in accounting and ski resorts, rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail, Stahle said.)\n\n&gt;“I think it’s very telling that we’re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago,” Stahle said. “There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall.”\n\n&gt;Retail especially has “just really pulled back,” he said.\n\n&gt;The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119,000 positions that month, though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts. The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare, food services and drinking places, and social assistance, and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior.\n\n&gt;Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans. Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year.\n\n&gt;A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach, saying, “For the past few years, we’ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates. It’s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive.”\n\n&gt;Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year, some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a K-shaped economy. A recent survey of 1,048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America’s Future found that 68% of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year, while 59% anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year. Just 5% of respondents were actively hiring or expanding, while 16% were scaling back, the survey found.\n\n&gt;Read more: What is a 'K-shaped economy,' and what's causing the divide?\n\n&gt;The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending.\n\n&gt;Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring.\n\n&gt;“Employers aren’t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through, or to the degree in which people are going to spend, and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing,” Stahle said.",

I’m not making predictions or anything, just trying to understand the market side of it.\n\nVenezuela doesn’t export like it used to but they still sit on a massive amount of oil, so even a hint of military escalation usually freaks out the oil futures guys. Would be weird because the US only recently relaxed sanctions a bit, so if Trump goes full “we’re doing something big” again, that probably means oil jumps, energy stocks breathe for a bit, and airlines get punched in the face like usual.\n\nI’m wondering more about the broader market though. If it’s just a one-off strike, markets probably dip early then go back to normal (like they always do). But if it drags out or turns into some long political mess, then I can see VIX spiking, EM getting slapped, gold doing its “I’m useful again” thing, and everyone pretending they predicted it.\n\nTrump also flip-flops so much that it’s hard to take any of this seriously until something actually moves, but still… how are people thinking about the actual market reaction if this doesn’t just fade in a day?\n\nNot looking for political takes, just the market angle.\n\n",

I don’t even want to know what his plan for retirement is or what my mom has. I guess he opened a Roth but didn’t know he had to actively invest the money in it. Honestly I’m really scared for their retirement and if they will ever retire. I told him I would help and my suggestion is doing 50/50 into VT and SGOV since he probably should not have that much risk. What suggestions would you guys make?",

Kazuo Ueda said, stoking hopes that it could resume monetary tightening this year.\n\nThe central bank will pay special attention to the outlook for wage increases, he said in a speech to business leaders Monday in Nagoya, central Japan.\n\nSticky inflation backs the case for higher rates, but as living costs rise policymakers want to see commensurate growth in wages.\n\nUeda said the bank is actively collecting information regarding firms' stance toward pay increases ahead of its next policy-setting meeting scheduled for Dec. 18-19.\n\nAt that meeting--the final one of the year--the BOJ \"will consider the pros and cons of raising the policy interest rate and make decisions as appropriate,\" Ueda said.\n\nWhile policymakers at the central bank have signaled that a rate hike is likely in the near future, market participants and economists have been divided on when it will happen.\n\nPersistent inflation suggests that conditions are becoming ripe for the central bank to make a move, but some economists say Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's preference for expansive economic policies complicates the path to monetary tightening.\n\nThis tension, combined with lingering uncertainty over the full impact of U.S. tariffs and the need for inflation expectations to become firmly anchored, has split views on when the BOJ will act next.\n\nBut after Ueda's remarks on Monday, markets seem to be leaning toward a December hike. The yen recovered against the dollar, reaching around 155.50 in morning trade after weakening to near 157.90 recently. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose to 1.850%, the highest since June 2008.\n\nIn response to the speech, Capital Economics changed its call for a January rate hike, now expecting the BOJ to lift its policy rate to 0.75% in December.\n\n\"If the bank does indeed raise its policy rate in a couple of weeks, we'd still expect two more rate hikes in 2026,\" it said in a note.\n\nUeda said raising rates at an appropriate speed won't put the brakes on Japan's economy--rather, it would take the foot off the accelerator enough to achieve growth and price stability.\n\nGradually adjusting interest rates \"will ultimately lead to the success of the efforts undertaken by the government and the bank thus far,\" he said.",

      "content": "Stock Ideas from Barron's 12/1: RBLX, D, SHOP, GOOGL\n\nSome of the best ideas I've gotten to invest in stocks over the last 20 years have come from the pages of Barron's Magazine, so I'm going to start trying to summarize some of the stock picks made by Barron's in the current week's magazine.  Barron's is released on Fridays after the market closes, so Monday is the first day to trade on their picks, and historically a Barron's recommendation can have a market moving effect because their influence on Wall Street is so strong.  But do your own research and due diligence.\n\nFrom the December 1 Magazine:\n\nRBLX.  Barron's thinks Roblox can move up 50% over the next 12 months, given its growing influence among children and young gamers, its low cost tools for designing new games and viral method of distribution.  Article quotes an analyst who calls Roblox the Youtube of the online gaming industry.  Stock is 30% off its highs given concerns about safety and content moderation regulation, but for the adventurous investor this might present a buying opportunity.\n\nD.  Dominion Energy has been on the rise YTD but is only reaching a stock price that it reached back in 2023.   Dominion has a reasonable P/E of 17 and a dividend yield of 4.3%.  The catalyst:  D is favorably resolving a regulatory issue over a big wind project under development which has depressed its stock price for 2 years.  It is now is poised to benefit from the rise in data center energy needs that other electric utility stocks already have.     \n\nSHOP.  A Barron's article about AI enabling the retail industry, Barron's highlights Shopify as one of the early winners.  Shopify's most recent earnings report showed early signs that AI is helping SHOP help their customer's online operation to increase revenues.  \n\nGOOGL.  Google was a big pick by Barron's six months ago to \"play catch-up\" with the rest of the MAG7 stocks as it was by far the most undervalued. Barron's call was very timely and lucrative, and two items in this week's Barron's reiterate the recommendation, one highlighting the break-out of Google Gemini 3 as the leading AI LLM, and the second article citing the emergence of Google's TPU chips as a competitive threat to Nvidia GPUs as evidenced by Meta's rumored deal to use Google Cloud and TPUs to power its AI.

Today it is about $22 trillion.\nInflation adjusted (22/1.03^26), this is about $10 trillion in 1999 dollars, so we have a 2.3x greater money supply today than we did in 1999, inflation adjusted.\n\nI wonder - does this mean our valuations would also translate roughly 2.3x higher? Hence, if the p/e was about 30 in 1999, with 2.3x the money supply, would an equivalent “bubble” p/e be 2.3x30=69?\n\nIf so, maybe it’s different this time… ;) just kidding. But I do feel like the M2 could have some impact on juicing values and therefore raising the “bubble” threshold. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I've read the estimated loss is from 13 to 18 billion annually. The likelihood of this happening is High. So let's assume the higher end 18B. \n\nThey are going through efficiency changes and trying to cut 7B until 2027 annualy on costs. Likelihood of this is moderate. They did go through bunch of acquisitions I believe there are somewhat clear ways to find efficiency. \n\nAcquired companies are meant to replace the lost revenue with new products. Estimates for those are all over the place from 10B to 35B. Depending on how actively analysts are trying to sell their book. But the general consensus is that company did buy some really promising oncology treatment drugs and maybe they can get some portion of the market share of weight loss drugs. I mean there must be a reason Novo were also bidding for Metsera acquisition, right? \n\nIf we go with 25B of revenue gain from new products, we're looking at 69.5B in revenue by 2030 - CAGR 2.5%. Not impressive and has an execution risk. But combined with 7B cost cutting initiative. It is actually enough to re rate stock to a higher PE value, simply because it is trading so low. \n\nI'd rate it as a hold. I really wanted to buy it for 7% yield at such a low valuation and optionality of a re rating, but for me it is not worth the risk. The pipeline is too vast for me to digest in one week. Maybe I'll read more and find conviction. ",

This represents a modest 17% upside from current levels.\n\nHowever, I am fundamentally optimistic about Novo Nordisk’s long-term growth prospects. Under my base-case assumptions—which include continued demand for obesity and diabetes treatments, expanding international revenue, and sustained cash-flow growth—the intrinsic valuation rises to 617 DKK per share for the company’s Class B stock. This reflects a compelling 114% potential upside for long-term investors.\n\nLong Read:   \nI spent the past few days going over Novo Nordisk's numbers and conducted a discounted cash flow valuation of the company.\n\nThere's some people on Seeking Alpha saying Novo Nordisk is a \"Value Trap\". My valuation states the opposite: even at a zero growth situation, Novo Nordisk is still undervalued. In case of positive growth, it's severely undervalued.

      "content": "How should I deal with it?\n\nI recently started a small clothing business. The idea is: I source vintage items from Japan and ship them back to Vietnam, where my friend helps receive the packages and handle local shipping. His role is basically picking which items to import and coordinating deliveries. We’ve only been running this for three days, but the early numbers look pretty promising.\n\nThe problem started when his close friend (they’ve known each other since middle school) suddenly decided to copy the exact same business model I’m doing. Then he invited my partner to join his new business.\n\nAt first, that guy also asked me to team up with them, but I refused because he has a history of running away from debt and being involved in messy situations. I didn’t want to get tied up with someone like that.\n\nAfter I declined, my current partner’s attitude changed. He told me he “wants to talk about salary” and then said he’s been busy with school lately and wants to “focus on studying more.” It felt like he was slowly distancing himself after his friend offered him something.\n\nI’m just starting this business and already running into this kind of situation. How should I deal with it?\n. ",

      "content": "Rotisserie Chicken biz\n\nI'm interested in starting a take- out only rotisserie chicken business using a similar concept to Boston Market. \n\nThe closest Costco to my area is 40 minutes on a good traffic day and we have 2 grocery stores that sell small rotisserie chickens but they 15-20 minutes in either direction. \n\nWe have few options for pre-cooked healthy-ish meals in my area and with families so busy and the increase in people buying prepared meals and meal kits I feel like it would do well here. \n\n\nPlus, most of the store rotisserie chickens are packaged hot in black plastic which is very unhealthy. They are injected with saline, sugar and other chemicals and preservatives. I want to offer a healthier option. \n\nI've been searching for examples of similar businesses  and have found only a few food trucks and several Hispanic or Peruvian style businesses that offer whole chickens. \n\nif you have thoughts on this model or know of a place like this in your area please comment. This is something I've been thinking of doing for quite some time. I've run the numbers and it appears to be a profitable venture. Please share your thoughts. Thank you! ",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis - Day Horizon**\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: BEARISH with High Volatility & Distrust**\nThe aggregate sentiment is **bearish**, driven by:\n- **Retail Fear & Distrust:** Reddit discussions highlight extreme volatility in crypto ($400M Bitcoin liquidations), political distrust (cancelled economic reports, Trump's impact on prices), and a focus on \"MOASS\" and \"Burry\" signaling deep-seated bearish bets and conspiracy-driven trading.\n- **Macroeconomic Deterioration:** Weak consumer spending (seasonal hiring down 25%), a \"K-shaped\" recovery (only high-end spending strong), and slumping China manufacturing point to global growth concerns.\n- **Market Data Confirmation:** Sharp declines in tech (NVDA -2.08%) and semiconductor leveraged bear ETF (SOXS -5.37%) suggest sector rotation out of growth. VIX at 17.21 indicates elevated fear.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES:**\n- **Economic Fragmentation & Weakness:** \"K-shaped economy,\" declining hiring, weak consumer spending, and China's manufacturing slump.\n- **Cryptocurrency Volatility & Leverage Risk:** Bitcoin's violent sell-off and massive long liquidations dominate retail attention.\n- **Political & Policy Uncertainty:** Cancelled economic reports, Trump's regulatory impact (bank deregulation, Venezuela oil comments), and poll data on inflation perceptions.\n- **AI & Automation Drive:** Nvidia's push for AI automation reflects corporate focus on efficiency amid economic pressure.\n- **Commodity & Geopolitical Shifts:** Oil reacting to Trump/OPEC+ comments, India securing cheap soyoil, and Russian oil market persistence.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS:**\n- **Negative Catalyst:** Bitcoin's flash crash likely triggered broader risk-off sentiment, impacting correlated tech/growth assets.\n- **Positive Catalyst (Selective):** Black Friday online sales +9.1% show digital resilience; Macau gaming beats estimates (premium spend).\n- **Warning Signal:** Cancelled key economic reports (jobs, inflation) erode market transparency, increasing uncertainty premiums.\n- **Sector Signal:** Energy (oil) rising on geopolitical supply risks; China auto retreat in Europe signals trade friction.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Primary Risks:**\n    1. **Liquidity Shock Risk:** Crypto liquidations could spill into equities if leveraged positions unwind.\n    2. **Consumer Recession Risk:** Weak hiring and spending suggest softening demand.\n    3. **Policy Volatility:** Unpredictable regulatory shifts (banking, oil, data reporting) increase systemic risk.\n    4. **China Slowdown:** Manufacturing slump may dampen global growth.\n- **Opportunities:**\n    1. **Defensive & Value Rotation:** Out-of-favor sectors with stable yields may benefit.\n    2. **Energy Geopolitical Premium:** Oil supply disruptions could support energy equities.\n    3. **AI Infrastructure:** Long-term AI adoption (NVDA narrative) remains intact despite short-term sell-off.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:**\n- **SECTOR: Energy (XLE)** – Watch for sustained oil price strength on OPEC+ and Venezuela geopolitical supply risks.  \n- **SECTOR: Consumer Discretionary (XLY)** – **Caution.** K-shaped spending suggests high-end luxury may hold (e.g., gaming, premium brands), but broad retail (HBI -1.82%) is weak.  \n- **SYMBOL: NVDA** – Near-term pressure from growth rotation, but AI automation theme is structural. Wait for stabilization above $170 for entry.  \n- **SYMBOL: BITO (Bitcoin Strategy ETF)** – Avoid until crypto volatility (VIX-like crypto metrics) subsides. Retail long liquidation cascade may not be over.  \n- **SYMBOL: TLT (Long-Term Treasuries)** – Consider as hedge. 10Y yield at 4.0% with rising economic fears could drive bond rallies.  \n- **Watchlist:** India growth surprise (IFN) and Macau gaming (WYNN, LVS) as contrarian pockets of strength.\n\n**IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Reduce exposure to highly leveraged retail favorites (meme stocks, crypto-correlated assets). Increase cash and defensive hedges. Monitor VIX for spikes above 20 as signal for broader de-risking.",

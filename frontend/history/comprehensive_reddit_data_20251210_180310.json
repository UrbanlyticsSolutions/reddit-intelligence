      "content": "Lyft -8% and Uber -7% as Waymo plans 1M weekly robotaxi rides and a major 2026 city expansion\n\nSource: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2025/12/10/waymo-targets-1-million-robotaxi-rides-a-week/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2025/12/10/waymo-targets-1-million-robotaxi-rides-a-week/)\n\n&gt;Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving tech unit, expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year, aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan. It’s the first time that the company, which started in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car project, has set a hard target for its business.\n\n&gt;Currently, the Mountain View, California-based company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Bay Area communities, Austin, Atlanta and, as of last month, Miami. That’s “a number that we’re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026,” Waymo said in a blog post. “As we look to 2026, we’re laying the early groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including international cities like Tokyo and London.”\n\n&gt;Waymo doesn’t share financial data, but various estimates suggest it makes at least $20 per ride, which adds up to more than $20 million a month. At 1 million rides per week, its annualized revenue would hit about $1 billion, a milestone for the early-stage robotaxi market. To handle that volume of rides the company’s fleet will likely expand to at least 10,000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2,500 now, likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar I-Pace SUVs.\n\n&gt;Though the service has proved popular with riders, Waymo’s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges. The company’s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco, for example, following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat, a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors. Last month, a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street. Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company, which hasn’t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans, needs to make additional safety upgrades.\n\n&gt;Additionally, Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses.\n\n&gt;“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s Waymo's chief safety officer, said in a statement.\n\n&gt;That said, Waymo’s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space, including General Motors’ Cruise unit, which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco. Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving, is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its so-called Full Self-Driving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use. Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it’s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD.\n\n&gt;But while Waymo’s safety issues so far haven’t been as serious, some critics think it’s expanding too fast, perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit.\n\n&gt;“We are left to wonder why the \\`world’s most experienced driver’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience,” Phil Koopman, an autonomous driving researcher and Carnegie-Mellon University professor, said in a blog post. “Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can’t shrug off. It’s unclear which will happen first.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdb2y6co2f6g1.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a57c7fde70895c2f2a58a9e940a52b32e0a1e342\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/issbp02p2f6g1.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f145ac6455a4fff50d43087cf8bb43b80713c4b3",

      "content": "Divided Fed approves third rate cut this year, sees slower pace ahead\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates again on Wednesday, but the decision came with unusually visible internal disagreement. The FOMC lowered the benchmark rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a 3.5%–3.75% range. While the move was widely expected, the tone around the announcement was far more cautious than markets were hoping for. The vote itself highlighted how divided policymakers have become. Three members dissented the most since 2019. Governor Stephen Miran pushed for a larger half-point cut, while Kansas City’s Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago’s Austan Goolsbee argued for no cut at all. That split essentially captures the Fed’s current dilemma: one camp is growing more concerned about weakening labor data, while the other worries that easing too fast could reignite inflation. This is Miran’s third straight dissent ahead of his January departure, and Schmid’s second. The mixed messaging reinforces the idea that although cuts are happening, the path forward may be slower and bumpier than markets expected. The Fed is easing, but not without hesitation and not without signaling that future moves are far from guaranteed.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/fed-interest-rate-decision-december-2025-.html?__source=androidappshare",

      "content": "Did people learn nothing from April\n\nIf you were fully invested in the S&amp;P 500 over a long period (usually 20–30 years), your returns were great.\n\nBut if you missed just the 10 best single days in that entire period, your return was cut roughly in half.\n\nThis is probably the most commonly cited anecdote as to why you should not time the market. I feel in at least half the investing books I've read, they mention this. I do not know of a single investor who has successfully timed the market consistently over any meaningful time period. Even Michael Burry, who is probably one of the most infamous investors for predicting the 08-09 recession, has wrongly called a market top an absurd number of times in recent years. \n\nBack in April, the market starts to sell off, and inevitably posts start popping up all over the subreddit talking about how they're selling and why they're selling and why this time is different. Of course, it wasn't different, and the market has proceeded to rip 20% since many folks here panic sold. \n\nHere we are, not even a year later in December, and people are asking unironically whether it's a good idea to move to cash or not. What do you think? Do you think that now is the time to finally start trying to time the market? After this age-old wisdom has been proven right, time and again? \n\nI feel like there's so many better ways to navigate an expensive market than by trying to time it. \n\nSuch as buying counter-cyclical companies, or buying companies that are recession-resistant, or buying companies at a larger margin for error. Heck, maybe even give bonds a shot?  But no. People are starting to come to the conclusion again that now is the time to time the market yet again and inevitably make a massive mistake. \n\n\nDO NOT TIME THE MARKET.\n\nEdit: This sub unironically defending timing the market lmao. The reason why this hurts people's feelings is because they sold back in April, and they're still waiting to get back in the market. Instead of taking a lesson, they double down on that timing the market is the correct thing. Whatever.",

Net income, at $6.14 billion, or $2.14 per share, rose from $3,151 billion, or $1.13 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings exclude stock-based compensation.\n\nThe company posted $7.98 billion in cloud revenue, more than the $7.92 consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount. Cloud infrastructure revenue totaled $4.1 billion.\n\nRemaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that hasn’t yet been recognized, soared 438% to $523 billion, topping the $501.8 billion average analyst estimate, according to StreetAccount. Doug Kehring, Oracle’s principal financial officer, said in the release that RPO were driven “by new commitments from Meta, Nvidia and others.”\n\nThe stock plummeted 23% in November, its worst monthly performance since 2001 and, as of Wednesday’s close, is 32% below its record reached in September. Still, the shares are up 34% for the year, outperforming the Nasdaq, which has gained 22% over that stretch.\n\nOracle generated $5.88 billion in software revenue, down 3% and lower than StreetAccount’s $6.06 billion consensus.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/oracle-orcl-q2-earnings-report-2026.html",

      "content": "Global Bond Yields Hit 16-Year High on Fading Rate-Cut Bets\n\nGlobal bond markets flashed a warning signal ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Long-dated government bond yields have climbed to levels last seen in 2009, suggesting traders are starting to question whether the era of broad rate-cut cycles is actually ending. A Bloomberg index tracking long-term sovereign yields is now back at 16-year highs. Futures markets reflect that shift: expectations for additional cuts from the European Central Bank have essentially vanished, Japan is seen as almost certain to hike this month, and Australia is now priced for two more quarter-point increases next year. The move comes just as the Fed prepares to announce its next decision. While most investors still expect a cut on Wednesday, the broader message from global markets is that easing may not last as long or run as deep as previously hoped. Anyone else watching this tightening narrative re-emerge? Bond markets usually sniff out trends early, and this feels like a meaningful shift.\n\n\n\nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bond-yields-hit-16-065429217.html)",

      "content": "Fed chair Powell asserts target rate of 3.50% - 3.75% is NEUTRAL\n\nSome possible consequences:\n\n* End of the \"Restrictive\" Phase: By labeling the current range as neutral, the Fed signals that its post-hike monetary policy is no longer actively restrictive or braking the economy.\n* Discussion goes from \"how much more easing is needed?\" to \"how long will we stay here?\"\n* Increased Market Uncertainty: Powell's estimate is notably higher than the 3.0% for the neutral rate among FOMC members. This discrepancy suggests increased variance of positions across the board. If the actual neutral rate is lower than 3.50%–3.75%, the Fed may be passively tightening, leading to a slower growth outlook. If the market believes the Fed is now neutral, it may expect rate cuts only if the economy shows clear signs distress, or drop in inflation.\n* The bar for future rate cuts is now higher. The Fed may be willing to hold rates at this level for an extended period, which could push up longer-term yields.\n\nIn sum: stocks may still rise, but the rates of rising will be more muted, and the probabilities of flat to down moves higher",

      "content": "The Broken Yardstick: Why Your “Historic” P/E Chart is Lying to You\n\n# The Broken Yardstick: Why Your “Historic” P/E Chart is Lying to You\n\nThere is a lot of talk about an ‘AI bubble’ and elevated SP500 multiples these days. If you have spent any time in financial social media circles you have certainly seen a chart comparing a graph of the S&amp;P 500’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio. The current multiple looks elevated, compared against a long-term average of \\~15/16x. The conclusion is always the same: “The market is expensive. A mean reversion is inevitable. We are in an AI bubble.”\n\nLet me start by making clear, this post is intended to provide some perspective and insight into the context of the current multiples, not to say the market PE isn’t elevated.\n\n**I am not saying that ‘this time is different’… BUT some things are different. Notably, the accounting rules we use to define the ‘E’ in P/E.”**\n\nComparing the S&amp;P500 PE ratio of today to that of the past is apples-to-oranges comparison. This common comparison assumes that the “E” (Earnings) in the 1990s and early 2000s measures the same thing as the “E” in 2025. It doesn’t.\n\nOver the last two decades, there have been several major accounting changes that have changed the way companies report profits. Almost every single change has made today’s accounting more conservative, suppressing reported earnings compared to the past. Those changes were made for a reason, much of today’s accounting is more transparent, it is more rational, but it makes comparison cloudy.\n\nLet’s look at what’s changed and what the impact has been…\n\n# The SBC Distortion: The Core 10-15% Earnings Drag:\n\nThe major difference of now vs then is the way GAAP requires companies to account for stock-based compensation (SBC).\n\nDid you know that stock-based compensation was only required to be recorded as an expense as of 2006? Before 2006, companies could issue massive stock options, dilute shareholders, and report zero expense on the income statement. SBC prior to 2006 has zero impact on Earnings Per Share (EPS). That ended with **FAS 123(R)**, which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other share-based payments on their income statements instead of just disclosing it in footnotes.\n\nToday, rightfully so, SBC is a required, non-cash, impact on earnings. It belongs in the income statement as an expense.\n\nBuffett and Munger agree, commenting on it in the 1998 Shareholder Letter, prior to the accounting rule changes described above.\n\n\"A few years ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not yet received an answer: “If options aren’t a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn’t go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?”\"\n\n(Cool Note: Berkshire terminated their stock options program at this time, opting to pay cash incentives so that their financials reporting reflected the true expense to their shareholders, voluntarily.)\n\n**On the change:** \"Though the two (incentive) plans are an economic wash, the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different accounting result. This Alice-in-Wonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost of stock options when earnings are being calculated, even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a great many corporations. In effect, accounting principles offer management a choice: Pay employees in one form and count the cost, or pay them in another form and ignore the cost. Small wonder then that the use of options has mushroomed.\"\n\n(Berkshire voluntarily chose to count the cost.)\n\n**The Impact:** SBC now accounts for roughly **10-15%** of total S&amp;P 500 earnings. If we reverted to 1999 rules, we would add that expense right back into the bottom line, drastically increasing bottom line earnings.\n\nHere’s a real world example.\n\nLet’s look at **Microsoft ($MSFT)** using current numbers (Q3 2025 Numbers). Looking at the financials, we can see the SBC impact on its valuation.\n\n**Current Numbers:**\n\nPrice (12/6/25): $483.15\n\nMarket Cap: \\~$3.59 trillion\n\nTTM Net Income: $104.91 billion\n\nDiluted EPS: $14.1\n\nGAAP PE: \\~34.26x\n\n**Pre-2006 Accounting Adjustment:**\n\nTTM Stock Based Compensation: $12.12 billion\n\nAdjusted Net Income (excluding SBC): $104.91b + $12.12b = $117.03b (-12.12% expense)\n\nAdjusted PE Ratio: \\~30.6x or a roughly 11% discount\n\nNow let’s look at **Microsoft ($MSFT)** during the 2000 peak.\n\n**Reported Numbers 2000:**\n\nMarket Cap (Peak): \\~$600 billion\n\nReported Operating Income: $11b\n\nReported Net Income: \\~9.4 billion\n\nDiluted EPS: $1.70\n\nHeadline PE: \\~62.82x\n\n**Adjusted Numbers (applying current day accounting rules):**\n\nMarket Cap (Peak): \\~$600 billion\n\nPro Forma Footnote Operating Income to adjust for SBC: $9.11b *(-17.2% impact)*\n\nPro Forma Footnote Net Income to adjust for SBC: \\~8.1b *(-13% impact)*\n\nDiluted EPS: $1.57 *(-12.9% impact)*\n\nAdjusted PE: \\~74.07x\n\n# MSFT 2001 and 2002: The gap widens…\n\n**2001:**\n\nReported Operating Income: $11.72b vs. Pro Forma: $8.34b *(-28.8% impact)*\n\nReported Net Income: $7.35b vs Pro Forma: $5.08b *(-30.9% impact)*\n\nReported Diluted EPS: $1.32 vs Pro Forma: $0.91 *(-31.1% impact)*\n\nQuarter Ending June 30, 2001 High Price: $73.68\n\n**Headline ‘reported’ PE: 55.81x** vs **Adjusted PE (current day SBC accounting): 80.96x**\n\n**2002:**\n\nReported Operating Income: $11.91b vs. Pro Forma: $8.27b (-30.6% impact)\n\nReported Net Income: $7.83b vs Pro Forma: $5.36b *(-31.5% impact)*\n\nReported Diluted EPS: $1.41 vs Pro Forma: $0.98 *(-30.5% impact)*\n\nQuarter Ending June 30, 2001 High Price: $60.38\n\n**Headline ‘reported’ PE: 42.82x** vs **Adjusted PE (current day SBC accounting): 63.65x**\n\nWhen you take required reporting changes into account, the picture changes.\n\n# But SBC isn’t the only accounting change holding back earnings... Regarding Intangibles:\n\nBeyond SBC, the American economy has changed and the companies that make up the S&amp;P500 have shifted from companies with tangible assets (factories, plants, equipment) to intangible assets (IP, software) and current day accounting rules penalize this shift in regards to valuation.\n\nFor reference: Back in 1975, intangible assets made up just 17% of assets on the balance sheets of S&amp;P 500 companies. Less than 50 years later, intangible assets exceed 90% of total assets on balance sheets. This is due to the domination of software in the economy and tech companies becoming the heaviest weighted sector in the S&amp;P 500 by market capitalization.\n\nWhile Goodwill amortization went away, in 2002 a new accounting rule replaced it with a new, massive expense: Amortization of Definite-Lived Intangibles.\n\nWhen Tech Company A buys Tech Company B, a large percentage of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets (Patents, Developed Technology, Customer Lists, etc.) Unlike Goodwill, these MUST be amortized. Because M&amp;A volume is so much higher today (and tech valuations are higher), this amortization expense has exploded. **For the S&amp;P 500, this is now often the single largest adjustment between GAAP (reported) earnings and Non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings, amounting to over $140 Billion per year in expenses.**\n\nIn other words, that is a -6% drag on the S&amp;P 500s net income, further compressing earnings and expanding multiples when compared to previous periods.\n\n# Regarding R&amp;D and the ‘Missing Amortization’:\n\nThe US economic and S&amp;P500 transition from a manufacturing capex heavy composition to a tech/innovation driven composition also creates challenges for comparison of as reported earnings multiples. The companies and the economy have changed but the expensing of investment in research and development is treated very differently than investment in manufacturing buildouts. This may be the biggest distortion to current day earnings vs historic.\n\nKeep in mind, we are obviously in a major capex cycle so many of the typically “capex light” tech companies are becoming more “capex heavy,” yet, the point still stands.\n\n**Old Economy:** If you build a factory, you capitalize the cost and depreciate it over 30 years. The hit to earnings is spread out via straight line depreciation.\n\n**New Economy (Software/Tech):** If you spend billions on R&amp;D to build software, you must expense it immediately. Because Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google spend massive amounts on R&amp;D ($211B+ combined annually as of FY2024), their reported earnings are impacted immediately, where an industrial company re-investing in its business smooths out the cost over multiple decades, drastically reducing the annual impact on earnings.\n\nAccording to a 2022 Morgan Stanley report by Michael Mauboussin:  \n\"The global economy continues to shift from one built on tangible assets to one built on intangible assets. Accounting, the means by which financial information is presented, treats tangible and intangible investments differently. This introduces bias into common metrics such as earnings.\n\nMost intangible investments appear on the income statement. Capitalizing those investments treats them in a fashion similar to capital expenditures. The result is that earnings and investments increase the same amount. This leaves free cash flow unchanged but provides a more accurate picture of a company’s operations.\n\nGiven the assumptions we use, **the capitalization of intangible investments would lead to net income for the S&amp;P 500 that is about 12 percent higher than what is reported.** These figures suggest great caution in comparing earnings or multiples over time.\"\n\nTaking this into account, earnings would be higher than 12% currently and the PE Ratio would be lower.\n\nSo, while reported earnings are benefiting from the lack of old school Goodwill amortization, they are being impacted far more by the immediate expensing of R&amp;D and the amortization of acquired tech. The net result is that current PE ratios are overstated relative to history because the earnings are being conservatively suppressed new modern day accounting rules.\n\n# But What Even Is the S&amp;P 500?\n\nFinally, let’s address the common complaint about the index itself: “The S&amp;P 500 is too top-heavy. The market is so concentrated.”\n\nSomewhere along the way, the S&amp;P 500 transitioned from being a passive tracking index of the US economy to an active financial product itself, serving as the favorite proxy for the overall stock market.\n\nBut the S&amp;P500 is a market-cap weighted index by design. It is not meant to be a representation of the average business; it is a momentum strategy. The index is built to reward our economy’s best companies by letting winners run and dropping the worst performers. When people complain that “the Mag7 is driving the index” they are essentially complaining that the winners are winning and that the strategy is working as intended.\n\nI see so many arguments that the “Mag 7” (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Nvidia, etc.) are distorting the market. But looking at them as just “7 stocks” is a mistake. They are diversified conglomerates. The Mag7 is more akin to the Mag70.\n\n* **Amazon** is a retailer, a logistics company, an advertising agency, and a Cloud hyperscaler, that is building satellites and working on robots…\n* **Microsoft** is enterprise SaaS, Cloud hyperscaler, Gaming studio.\n* **Google** is a Cloud hyperscaler, leading AI developer, the largest search business, advertiser, streaming service, AV operator, soon to be TPU business.\n\nThese companies are the most diversified businesses in the world and rightfully command a higher multiple not because of hype, but because they delivering seemingly unimaginable products, services, and financial results to match. Their net profit margins hover around **\\~26%**, roughly **double** the S&amp;P 500 average of **\\~13%**. They are twice as efficient at turning revenue into profit and their earnings growth is keeping pace with their multiple expansion.\n\nThe S&amp;P500 Index is not your only access to the stock market. You are not a forced buyer. Viewing the S&amp;P 500 as the only “investable universe” is misleading. We live in the golden age of ETFs and individual access to stock market research. No one is forcing you to buy the market-cap weighted index. Not happy with the composition? Stop viewing it as a product and view it as a tracking index as it initially was intended.\n\nWorried about concentration? Buy the Equal Weight S&amp;P 500.\n\nIf you choose to buy the S&amp;P500 index, you are making an active choice to bet on the winners. Stop being upset when they win.\n\n# Conclusion: The Normalizing Adjustment\n\nI started this post by saying I wasn’t arguing “this time is different,” but rather that the accounting is different.\n\nTo create a consistent comparison of S&amp;P500 valuations, we have to level the playing field. Remember, this is an exercise in expanding your perspective. I strongly prefer today’s accounting standards to those of the 1990s and use GAAP reported numbers as my baseline for company valuation. In no way am I suggesting you to do otherwise or that things should be changed. What I am suggesting is that you view the comparison of current day financial reporting with that of the past with a holistic perspective and acknowledge that things are different.\n\nLets strip away the layers of modern current day accounting changes to see what the market *really* looks like compared to the rules of the 1990s.\n\nHere is the step-by-step impact on the S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio (currently \\~29x) if we revert to historical rules:\n\n**The “SBC” Adjustment**\n\n* *The Change:* We add back the mandatory 10-15% Stock-Based Compensation expense that was hidden in the 90s.\n* *The Impact:* Earnings rise \\~12.5% (midpoint).\n* *The Result:* The P/E drops from **29x** to **\\~25.8x**.\n\n**The “R&amp;D Innovation” Adjustment**\n\n* *The Change:* We keep the SBC add-back AND we capitalize R&amp;D expenses (treating them as assets/investments like factories, rather than immediate costs).\n* *The Impact:* As noted by Morgan Stanley, this boosts earnings by another \\~12%.\n* *The Result:* The P/E drops from **25.8x** to **\\~23.0x**.\n\n**A “Full Scope” Adjustment**\n\n* *The Change:* We include the above, PLUS we adjust for the aggressive amortization of acquired intangibles through M&amp;A.\n* *The Impact:* We add back a conservative \\~3% drag (discounting from the full 6% to account for historical M&amp;A activity).\n* *The Result:* The P/E drops from **23.0x** to **\\~22.3x**.\n\n**The Reverse Adjustment: Today’s accounting applied to the past**\n\nFinally, let’s look at it the other way. What happens if we take the historical markets of the dot-com era and apply today’s accounting rules?\n\n* If we applied today’s SBC expensing rules to the 2000 peak, earnings would have been \\~10-20% lower.\n* The peak P/E of the Dot-Com bubble wasn’t 30x... by today’s standards it was **\\~34x - 38x**.\n\nWhen you compare a 22.3 - 25.8x market (Adjusted Today) to a 34x+ market (Adjusted History), some of the bubble talk can subside. Especially when you acknowledge that the average PE of the last 50 years is 19.5x vs the often cited all-time average of 16x.\n\nThe market is trading at a premium, but, in my opinion, is not in a bubble. We are in the midst of a technological revolution and company earnings are driving their multiples.\n\nThanks for reading. I hope you found this article interesting and helpful.

      "content": "Mastercard (MA) broke into our Top 5 Quality Picks for the first time since August. Here's the breakdown.\n\nWe've been running a scoring algorithm on S&amp;P 500 stocks since August. Basically scores companies on fundamentals and how they stack up against sector peers, then runs them through some validation checks. Only 5 stocks make the cut each month.\n\nMastercard broke in for the first time at #5 on 1st December. The profitability on this thing is genuinely ridiculous. 196.9% return on equity, 45.3% net margins. Scored perfect marks on returns and margin efficiency. Analysts are bullish too: 49 of 62 have it as a Buy, with literally zero Sells, and the consensus implies about 21% upside.\n\nThe problem is valuation. Stockoscope DCF puts intrinsic value around $382  based on 12.9% growth for 5 years, followed by 5 years of tapering growth to 2%, discounted at 8.1% (and it's trading at $537 currently). That's a pretty big premium to pay, even for something this high quality. The growth would have to be around 20% for it to be fairly valued.  \n  \nTechnicals: Currently, it is down 11% from the highs, and there is a nice support  around the 500 levels, which would be around a 16% drop from the top. That would be a better entry than the current level, of course.\n\nCurious where others land on this. The quality is undeniable, but it's a bit pricey. \n\nNot financial advice. DYOR.",

      "content": "SpaceX IPO Plan Puts $2.9 Trillion of Listings Back On the Table\n\nThere’s growing talk that as much as $2.9 trillion worth of long-private companies could start moving toward the public markets, with SpaceX often mentioned as the potential trigger. That would also open the door for other massive centicorns companies valued at $100B+ in private markets that have stayed private for years. The big question is whether public investors will actually be willing to buy into businesses that often have limited profits, controversial leadership, and valuations that already price in years of perfection. It feels like a test not just for the IPO market, but for risk appetite across Wall Street as a whole.\n\n  \nSource:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spacex-ipo-plan-puts-2-120000701.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spacex-ipo-plan-puts-2-120000701.html)",

      "content": "Divided Fed approves third rate cut this year, sees slower pace ahead\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates again on Wednesday, but the decision came with unusually visible internal disagreement. The FOMC lowered the benchmark rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a 3.5%–3.75% range. While the move was widely expected, the tone around the announcement was far more cautious than markets were hoping for. The vote itself highlighted how divided policymakers have become. Three members dissented the most since 2019. Governor Stephen Miran pushed for a larger half-point cut, while Kansas City’s Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago’s Austan Goolsbee argued for no cut at all. That split essentially captures the Fed’s current dilemma: one camp is growing more concerned about weakening labor data, while the other worries that easing too fast could reignite inflation. This is Miran’s third straight dissent ahead of his January departure, and Schmid’s second. The mixed messaging reinforces the idea that although cuts are happening, the path forward may be slower and bumpier than markets expected. The Fed is easing, but not without hesitation and not without signaling that future moves are far from guaranteed.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/fed-interest-rate-decision-december-2025-.html?__source=androidappshare",

      "title": "Adobe Q4 Earnings Discussion",
      "content": "Adobe Q4 Earnings Discussion\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI know Adobe has been a battleground stock here for the last year. The \"Bear Case\" was simple and terrifying: Generative AI (Midjourney, Sora, Canva) is going to zero-out Adobe's moat. The stock got hammered down to ~$345 because of this fear.\n\nWell, Q4 earnings just dropped, and I think the \"AI is a headwind\" narrative is dead. In fact, it looks like the opposite is happening.\n\nHere is my breakdown of the quarter and why I think this is a classic \"Buffett/Lynch\" setup (Wonderful Company at a Fair Price).\n\n1. The \"Lynch\" Catalyst: AI is actually monetizing\n\nThe scariest thing for a value investor is a \"value trap\" a cheap stock that is actually dying (e.g., Kodak). We needed proof that Firefly (Adobe's AI) wasn't just a toy.\n\nThe Data: Generative Credit consumption tripled in Q4.\n\nThe Beat: Revenue came in at $6.19B (vs $6.11B expected).\n\nTakeaway: Enterprise clients cannot use open-model AI due to copyright risks. They are flocking to Adobe because it's the \"safe\" AI layer. The moat is holding.\n\n2. The \"Fisher\" Strategic Move: The Semrush Acquisition\n\nManagement announced plans to acquire Semrush for $1.9B.\n\nSome might hate the M&amp;A (remember Figma?), but at $1.9B, this is bite-sized compared to their cash pile.\n\nStrategy: It closes the loop. Create content (Photoshop) -&gt; Manage it (Experience Cloud) -&gt; Optimize it for SEO (Semrush). It makes the ecosystem stickier.\n\n3. The \"Graham\" Valuation &amp; Safety\n\nP/E Ratio: ~21.38x. For a monopoly with 89% gross margins? That is historically cheap.\n\nBuybacks: Management authorized a fresh $25B buyback. They are literally shouting that they think the stock is undervalued.\n\nBalance Sheet: Net cash neutral even after the proposed Semrush deal.\n\nThe Bear Case (and why it's fading)\n\nThe risk was that AI makes \"editing\" obsolete (prompt-to-final-result). While valid long-term, the Q4 numbers show that professionals are using AI inside Photoshop, not instead of it. The workflow is evolving, not evaporating.\n\nMy thoughts-\nWe are getting a \"Stalwart\" at a cyclical trough. The market priced ADBE like it was the next Chegg. Q4 proved it's still the King of Creatives.\n\n\nTL;DR: AI fear crushed the price, but Q4 earnings proved AI is actually driving revenue. Buying a monopoly with a massive buyback tailwind feels like a no-brainer.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is the Semrush deal a distraction or a smart bolt-on? And are you worried about the SBC (Stock Based Comp) levels, or does the buyback offset it enough for you?",

      "content": "When do you allow yourself to sacrifice future gains for present pleasures?\n\nHey all, I've been investing diligently since about 2016. In that time I've made a lot of sacrifices and life choices and my NW has gone up accordingly. My wife and I have been frugal in our spending on literally everything and because of that we bought our first house last year. Even with the mortgage debt our total combined household NW is positive. No matter how you slice it, we've accomplished a lot of success in the last 9 years financially. \n\nI'm a car guy. I've always loved cars and car culture. 3 years ago I actually bought my first fun car, a 2000 Porsche Boxster S with 160k miles on the clock I paid $5k for. It's a blast on back roads and I've enjoyed having it, but at the end of the day it's a $5000, 25 year old car that wasn't cared for very much by previous owners. Parts and components are old and worn down, and although I've already done some major work on the car myself (being very frugal forces you to learn a lot of fun new skills) I know that my time with this little sportscar will come to an end soon. Its simply a little too rough around the edges and the money it would cost to get it where it needs to be is more than I'm willing to spend, even if I do all the labor myself. \n\nMy dream car has always been a 2004 Porsche 911 C4S. It was the car I grew up lusting after as a kid and I've dreamed of owning one for as long as I can remember. Right now those cars are selling for an average of $40k, with higher mileage and rougher examples selling for about half that. Obviously I'd like to spend as little as possible but after my experience with the Boxster, I'd much rather splurge on the initial purchase of a well maintained car rather than try to make the money back in DIY repairs. \n\nThe thing is, $40k is a lot of money. Hell, $20k is a lot of money! I've still got 20 years until retirement so dropping $40,000 today on a fun car will cost me $150k in retirement money. Even if I come in on the low end I'm still losing out on $77k in retirement wealth. No matter how I slice it, the car is going to cost a fortune to own. \n\nFor those of you who are also afflicted with expensive hobbies like this, whatever it might be, how do you square the circle of enjoying those experiences today even though you know it's costing you some in retirement? When does that math no longer matter to you and you can say, \"Fuck it\" and just enjoy that thing now?",

      "content": "Payment processor for small business\n\nHey all . So we are a small business currently with clover . Paying about 30$ per month for the debit machine and a few fees on top of that. Then plus the card processing fees . So far I’ve noticed I’m paying around 2% of total sales . There is also a minimum discount fee I found out about that is when the minimum threshold of sales wasn’t made and it’s quite a lot about 20$+ so far. Just want to see what yall are using and paying and recommend . Before choosing clover I did compare with a few other companies like square and moneris . At the moment I’ve looked into helcim and also inkas . ",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-10 18:02:09 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: Cautiously Bearish with Policy Anxiety**\nThe sentiment is **conflicted but leaning bearish**. The dominant narrative is one of **policy-driven uncertainty** overshadowing a dovish Fed.\n*   **Reddit (Retail Sentiment):** Overwhelmingly focused on Fed rate cuts (multiple high-scoring posts), but the tone is not celebratory. Top themes include warnings about the efficacy of cuts, geopolitical risks (Europe/Trump/Ukraine), and sector-specific fears (autonomous vehicles). The resurgence of \"GameStop\" and \"crypto exit\" posts suggests a shift toward meme/nostalgia trading, often a sign of low conviction in broader markets.\n*   **Institutional & Macro Data:** The Fed has cut rates to 3.75% (Fed Funds: 3.89%), yet the 10Y Treasury Yield remains elevated at 4.18%. This **persistent yield curve flattening/inversion** signals bond market skepticism that rate cuts will stimulate growth, instead potentially pricing in longer-term inflation or fiscal concerns. A VIX at 16.93 indicates **elevated, but not panicked, near-term volatility expectations**.\n\n**Verdict:** The market is digesting a \"dovish\" Fed move as a potential symptom of underlying economic weakness (\"danger\" signal per Reddit post #12), compounded by geopolitical headlines. This creates a **\"bad news is bad news\"** environment.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES: The Three Pillars of Uncertainty**\n1.  **Monetary Policy Crossroads:** The Fed's third consecutive cut is the central event. However, the theme is **\"Mission Unaccomplished.\"** Discussions question whether lower policy rates will translate to lower consumer/business borrowing costs (Reddit #4, News #6). The forward guidance for a \"slower pace\" adds to uncertainty.\n2.  **Geopolitical & Fiscal Risk Escalation:** A potent mix of U.S. domestic and international policy fears. Headlines on **potential European dumping of U.S. Treasuries** (Reddit #1) in response to Trump's foreign policy represent a direct threat to bond market stability and the dollar. This intersects with news on Trump-era regulatory actions (truck drivers) and trade tensions (Japan-China spat).\n3.  **Sector Disruption & AI Dichotomy:** **Autonomous vehicle competition** is hitting ride-sharing stocks (Reddit #3). Conversely, **defense/AI integration** is a clear winner (Palantir's $448M Navy deal - Reddit #8). This highlights a market rewarding tangible, contracted AI applications over speculative consumer tech.\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n*   **Primary Catalyst (Today):** FOMC Decision & Powell's Press Conference. The market's interpretation is key: \"less hawkish than expected\" (News #6) but with a warning label attached.\n*   **Critical Signal - Bond Market Rebellion:** The **+29 bps spread between the 10Y Yield (4.18%) and Fed Funds (3.89%)** is a glaring red flag. It suggests the bond market is pricing in either: 1) higher term premium due to Treasury supply/fiscal fears, or 2) inflation expectations that the Fed is behind on. European \"dumping\" whispers amplify this risk.\n*   **Contrarian Sentiment Signal:** The viral \"I Wasted 8 Years in Crypto\" post and GameStop nostalgia trending alongside major macro news may indicate a **retail trader retreat to familiar, non-fundamental plays**, a potential sign of exhaustion or confusion in mainstream markets.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Geopolitical-Fiscal Spiral:** A trigger that causes foreign official selling of U.S. debt, accelerating yield rises and destabilizing risk assets.\n    2.  **Policy Ineffectiveness:** The Fed loses credibility if rate cuts fail to lower meaningful market rates or boost confidence, revealing deeper economic cracks.\n    3.  **Concentrated Tech Weakness:** AI leaders (e.g., NVDA slightly down) failing to rally in a dovish environment is concerning. Sector-specific disruption (e.g., AVs vs. Ride-hail) creates stock-picking landmines.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Defense/AI Infrastructure:** Companies with government contracts for mission-critical digital modernization are in a sweet spot (see Palantir).\n    2.  **Volatility Hedging:** Elevated VIX and macro uncertainty support strategies for volatility exposure or tail-risk hedging.\n    3.  **Quality & Yield:** In a \"higher for longer\" real yield environment, companies with strong balance sheets and sustainable dividends may regain favor.\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n**WATCH:**\n*   **DXY / EURUSD:** For immediate reactions to European debt threat headlines.\n*   **10Y Treasury Yield ($TNX):** A sustained break above 4.25% would signal intensifying bond market stress.\n*   **Fed Speakers:** Any commentary attempting to narrow the Fed Funds/10Y spread.\n\n**ACT:**\n*   **SECTOR: DEFENSE/TECH INTEGRATION - BULLISH.** Favor firms with sovereign government AI/software contracts. This theme is insulated from consumer weakness and benefits from geopolitical tension.\n    *   **PLTR:** Direct beneficiary of major new contract; a pure-play on this theme.\n    *   **LDOS, NOC, RTX:** Watch for follow-on \"digital modernization\" deal flow.\n*   **SECTOR: AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES / DISRUPTED TRANSPORT - CAUTIOUS.** The Waymo expansion is a structural headwind for traditional ride-hail.\n    *   **LYFT, UBER:** Avoid or hedge. Competitive moat is under direct threat.\n    *   **GOOGL (Waymo owner):** Monitor for positive spin-off value recognition.\n*   **SYMBOL: NVDA - NEUTRAL/WATCH.** The slight decline on a dovish Fed day is a minor warning sign. It must hold key support (watch $180) to maintain its market leadership status. Failure would be a broad risk-off signal.\n*   **MACRO: TREASURIES - BEARISH (PRICES) / CAUTIOUS.** Avoid long-duration Treasury bonds (e.g., **TLT**) until the geopolitical overhang clears and the yield curve normalizes. The risk/reward is poor.\n*   **TRADE: VOLATILITY - LONG.** Consider strategic, limited positions in **VXX** or **UVXY** calls as a hedge against a geopolitical or bond market spike. The VIX level offers a relatively cheap entry for insurance.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is in a fragile state where a dovish Fed is being interpreted through a lens of weakness and external risk. **Tactical defense and selectivity are paramount.** The largest near-term threat is not the Fed, but the bond market's reaction to simmering geopolitical and fiscal tensions.",

      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

      "title": "Musk wins appeal and restores 2018 Tesla pay deal worth $56 billion",
      "content": "Musk wins appeal and restores 2018 Tesla pay deal worth $56 billion\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Delaware's Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package from Tesla, which was once valued at $56 billion. Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.”\n\nThe ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThis compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November.\n\nThe ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares.\n\nMusk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock.\n\nIn 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded.\n\nMusk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies.\n\nTesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands.\n\nIn November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales.\n\nTesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan.\n\nThe Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

Instead of recreating the letters I will simply be linking them:\n\nhttps://theoraclesclassroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1966-Berkshire-AR.pdf\n\nKey Paragraph:\n\n&gt; In addition to the cyclical nature of our business, there are other reasons why a strong financial condition is advisable. As you have been advised previously, the Company has been searching for suitable acquisitions within, and conceivably without, the textile field. Although to date none has been successfully concluded, we continue to have an active interest in such acquisitions. The present state of the money market, in which funds are virtually unobtainable for acquisition purposes, makes it imperative that we have available the liquid assets with which to consummate such acquisitions, should the hoped-for opportunities present themselves. Present uncertainties such as war, tax rates and decreased level of business activity also all combine to emphasize the continuing need for a strong financial condition.\n\nHe is letting the shareholders know he is on the hunt for acquisitions \"within and without, the textile field.\" \n\nI think otherwise this year a big goal of his was soothing shareholders. This is the only time Berkshire Hathaway paid a dividend under his tenure, and there was also a buyback of 37% of its stock. It is celebrating that the numbers now look like the numbers from Berkshire's best years. From here on out excess capital will almost always get re-invested instead of returned to shareholders. It seems like he was throwing them a big bone after his takeover of the company to get them ready for him to take the business in an entirely new direction next year.",

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions. These bonds would likely be best suited in a retirement account due to the federal, state, and local tax implications.",

I’ve also looked at forward-looking P/E ratios, where I want to see a clear decline from today’s P/E.\n\nIn addition to that, profitability and growth are, as usual, important to me.

      "content": "Long-term satellite allocation: Google vs Nvidia vs Broadcom (10–15 years)\n\nHi,\n\nI’m looking for some input on a small satellite allocation within an otherwise simple, long-term portfolio (core is a broad global ETF with ongoing DCA).\n\nMy satellites currently include Google (GOOG), Nvidia (NVDA), and Broadcom (AVGO), but together they only make up a small % of my total portfolio.\n\nGiven that limited size, I’m wondering:\n\nDoes it make more sense to concentrate on 1–2 names instead of holding all three?\n\nFor a 10–15 year horizon, which would you prioritize:\n\nGoogle (diversified cash machine + AI optionality), or\n\nNvidia (AI leader, higher growth but more cyclicality/valuation risk)?\n\n\nWhere does Broadcom fit for long-term conviction?\n\n\nThis isn’t about short-term trading, just optimizing a long-term satellite sleeve while the core keeps compounding.\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks \n\nEDIT: maybe I should add AMAZON....?",

      "content": "Can someone explain this to me?\n\nSo, over the years of adding a little of my paycheck to a few mutual funds, I have had $8,500 in PBLAX. They have been providing fairly consistent returns. I was content. But, last week the capital gains payout came, which was $1,766, I had it automatically set up to reinvest. But lately, almost all of the profits of the investment in PBLAX have gone in the red.\n\nMy question is, why is it when they had a good enough year for a great payout on investment, did so many of my investments go into the red?",

Tech comes with larger volatility, but due to the length of my time horizon, would these swings still out perform the broad market over a longer time frame? Essentially will volatility drag erode the CAGR of heavy tech investment over 20 years compared to a diversified approach? ",

      "content": "Are energy stocks about to blow up or they priced in already with AI?\n\nBeen getting tiktoks where certain states are running out of power because of data centers. I don't know if this is old news or if this is something that might be the next sector that is trending other than semiconductors. In my opinion I think the tech side is slowing down and only so much can be innovated when it comes to GPUs, Semis, we are now seeing RAM prices go up with data centers being built. But with data centers being built rumor has it the US power grid can barely keep up with winter (Texas / Illinois specifically) and black outs in summer. \n\nI was eyeing a few energy stocks ($BE, FSLR, GEV, BESF ETF) but I was wondering if these are already priced in? Is energy sector something that is lacking or can money be made in this sector? \n\nI think FSLR will be slower as solar can only do so much. $BE might be the way to go, GEV looks like it has amazing potential and BESF ETF too but I don't have the data on whats comprised in that ETF. (FINVIZ Subscription ran out)\n\n$BE also crashed with the rumor when SPACE X goes public they will put data centers in space, but the argument is space is cold and imo that idea is far fetched just to get Space X in the spot light. \n\nA month ago I was eyeing data center construction stocks but now with the US infrastructure I think energy might be the next trending sector?

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS  \n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 23:32:05  \n**Time Horizon:** Day  \n\n---\n\n### 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral to Cautiously Bullish**  \n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Mixed. Retail traders show speculative interest in meme stocks (GameStop, RKLB) and options trading, but discussions also reflect skepticism toward economic data and generational wealth disparities. The top post about a potential FTC investigation into trading card grading monopolies suggests heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may spill over into other speculative retail sectors.  \n- **News Sentiment:** Moderately positive. Bloomberg highlights a \"bull market not all about tech,\" record M&A activity in Japan, and rising stocks amid large options expiry. However, concerns around oil oversupply, noisy economic data, and corporate delinquencies (New Fortress Energy) introduce caution.  \n- **Macro/Technical Data:**  \n  - **VIX at 16.87** suggests subdued near-term volatility expectations.  \n  - **10Y Yield at 4.12%** and Fed Funds at 3.64% indicate a stable but restrictive rate environment.  \n  - **Equity Risk Premium of 4.33%** supports equity attractiveness relative to bonds.  \n- **Conclusion:** Institutional tone is cautiously optimistic, while retail sentiment is fragmented—split between speculative gambles and macroeconomic distrust.\n\n---\n\n### 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES  \n1. **Regulatory & Antitrust Scrutiny:**  \n   - Reddit: FTC investigation into Collectors Holdings (trading card grading).  \n   - News: DOJ Epstein files release may indirectly pressure institutions.  \n   - Implication: Regulatory risks are rising for niche markets and could expand.  \n\n2. **Economic Data Distrust:**  \n   - Reddit: Posts criticize housing inflation data (\"assumes zero housing inflation\") and question economic leadership (\"Why America gave up on economists\").  \n   - News: Bloomberg quotes \"Data Is Very Noisy,\" reflecting institutional skepticism.  \n   - Implication: Market reactions to economic releases may be amplified by credibility gaps.  \n\n3. **Retail Speculation & Meme Stock Revival:**  \n   - Reddit: GameStop, RKLB, and options trading are trending. Posts like \"ThetaGang Goes Wrong\" highlight retail options education.  \n   - Market Data: LAZR (+174.73%) and BBAI (+11.19%) show extreme retail-driven moves.  \n   - Implication: Meme stock volatility is resurfacing, potentially signaling a risk-on retail crowd.  \n\n4. **Global Supply Chains & Trade Tensions:**  \n   - News: China’s rare-earth magnet exports to US decline; Modi fast-tracks reforms to counter US tariffs; oil oversupply concerns.  \n   - Implication: Geopolitical shifts are affecting commodity and industrial sectors.  \n\n5. **AI Disruption & Labor Market Fears:**  \n   - Reddit: \"Due to AI, they can't find a job\" (Stanford graduates).  \n   - News: \"Bull market isn't all about tech\" suggests sector rotation.  \n   - Implication: AI winners and losers are emerging, with human capital displacement becoming a social-economic theme.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS  \n- **Options Expiry Impact:** Bloomberg notes $7.1 trillion in options expiring, likely contributing to Friday’s stock climb (gamma squeeze dynamics).  \n- **Commodity Signals:** Oil prices poised to fall further—bearish for energy equities, bullish for transportation and consumer discretionary.  \n- **Credit Stress Signals:** New Fortress Energy’s delinquent payments point to rising distress in leveraged sectors, especially energy infrastructure.  \n- **Technical Signal:** NVDA’s +3.93% gain suggests big tech resilience, but news warns against overconcentration.  \n- **Macro Signal:** Low VIX + high equity risk premium = favorable for equities, but inflation data skepticism (CPI 325.031) may limit Fed dovishness.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. RISK ASSESSMENT  \n**Primary Risks:**  \n1. **Regulatory Surprises:** FTC/DOJ actions could spark selloffs in collector assets, fintech, or meme stocks.  \n2. **Data Credibility Crisis:** If market participants dismiss official data, volatility may increase around economic releases.  \n3. **Retail Overextension:** Extreme moves in low-float stocks (LAZR, PRPH) signal froth; a reversal could trigger broad retail de-risking.  \n4. **Global Trade Disruptions:** US-China rare-earth tensions and Indian tariff defenses may disrupt tech and manufacturing supply chains.  \n5. **Oil Price Collapse:** Prolonged oversupply could hurt energy earnings and high-yield debt markets.  \n\n**Primary Opportunities:**  \n1. **M&A Boom:** Japan’s record deal activity may spread to other regions—look for undervalued mid-caps with strong balance sheets.  \n2. **Sector Rotation:** Non-tech bull market narrative suggests value/industrial sectors may catch up.  \n3. **Defensive Yield Plays:** With ERP at 4.33%, dividend stocks and utilities may attract capital if growth stalls.  \n4. **Volatility Suppression:** Low VIX favors selling options premium (e.g., covered calls) in stable large-caps.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS  \n**For Traders (Day Horizon):**  \n- **GME, RKLB, LAZR:** Monitor for meme stock momentum—high risk, but gamma squeezes possible given retail chatter.  \n- **OIL ETFS (USO, XLE):** Avoid long energy exposure; consider shorts on rallies given oversupply news.  \n- **NVDA:** Tech leadership intact, but beware of exhaustion after +3.93% move; support at $175.  \n\n**For Investors (Strategic):**  \n- **SECTOR: Industrials & Materials:** Beneficiaries of Japan M&A boom and US tariff defenses (e.g., CAT, DE).  \n- **SECTOR: Utilities & Consumer Staples:** Defensive plays if data distrust triggers flight to safety.  \n- **SYMBOL: GLD:** Gold at $399.02 may hedge against data credibility risks and geopolitical tensions.  \n- **SYMBOL: TLT:** 10Y yield at 4.12% offers attractive entry for bond exposure if growth fears resurface.  \n\n**Watchlist:**  \n- **Regulatory Developments:** FTC actions on monopolies.  \n- **Economic Data:** Next CPI/housing releases for validation.  \n- **Retail Flow:** GameStop and options activity as sentiment gauge.  \n- **Credit Markets:** New Fortress Energy outcome as canary for high-yield stress.  \n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** The market is balancing institutional optimism (M&A, sector rotation) against retail speculation and data skepticism. Trade the range, hedge with gold/bonds, and avoid overexposure to frothy retail favorites. Regulatory and geopolitical developments are key near-term catalysts.",

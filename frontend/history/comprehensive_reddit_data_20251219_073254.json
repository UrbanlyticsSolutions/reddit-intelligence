Trust me…I know. I’m in an absolute low right now and I pray that one day I can pullback. I managed to get a temporary extension for what is owed but I lost everything because I got lucky with liberation day, I made a lot because it and had plans to start my life with my girlfriend, she doesn’t know yet but each day I don’t tell her is killing me.\nI sold the house I grew up in, a burden I never wanted to deal with and I explicitly said I don’t want to worry about what is owed, I was naive enough to do my taxes on my own which came around liberation day and I genuinely did not expect to end the year like this.\nI made plans on paying my taxes several times and let it slip by and here I am.\nI wish a golden trade came my way and gave me a valuable life lesson and scare but I made my grave and I hope my girlfriend will forgive me.\nI have adhd and struggle with it daily, I chased the dopamine and panicked, fumbled hard.\nIf anything I wish to say please don’t do what I did, do not chase the dream because you’ll be left with a nightmare.\nIt’s so bad…",

This block carried a base reward of about 3.125 BTC (following the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced mining subsidies), plus additional transaction fees that pushed the total payout slightly higher. The block's hash is 0000000000000000000039a7a8d1b6b3b4f1e8e4f868c4, and it processed over 2,800 transactions, highlighting the ongoing activity on the Bitcoin network despite its immense scale.\n\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/928351\n\nI wouldn’t recommend you trying this though, as you probably will have better odds buying lottery tickets.

      "content": "Oracle +5% after hours after TikTok signs binding US joint venture with Oracle taking 15% stake\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-says-signed-agreements-create-222642566.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-says-signed-agreements-create-222642566.html)\n\n&gt;TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew told employees that the social media company and its parent, ByteDance Ltd., signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture majority-owned by American investors\n\n&gt;In an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Chew said he was “pleased to share some great news” and said agreements with Oracle Corp., Silver Lake and MGX have been signed. Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22, 2026.\n\n&gt;“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” Chew said in the memo. Meanwhile, “TikTok global’s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing,” he wrote.\n\n&gt;The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September, which was pending approval from China. Chew’s memo does not mention China’s opinion on the transaction. It says 50% of the investors will be new, with Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment company, retaining 15% each; 30.1% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance.\n\n&gt;After more than a year of negotiations, Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance’s popular video app to a consortium of investors. If finalized, the deal would remove a persistent issue in Beijing-Washington relations and signal progress in broader talks. But it would also deprive China’s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon.\n\n&gt;ByteDance’s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok’s business. Under the the deal proposed by Washington, ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity, which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle, TikTok’s cloud partner.\n\n&gt;Trump’s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know?: QuickTake\n\n&gt;The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement, which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration. US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app’s recommendation algorithm.\n\n&gt;Under the law, the initial deadline for the sell-or-ban rule was this past January, but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office, most recently pushing it into January 2026.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bes8jzkrv18g1.png?width=1587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f406b925304f2c0ce50176783172b3016adb28fc\n\n",

      "content": "Vitalik Buterin Warns Elon Musk That X's Hate Campaigns Could Hurt Free Speech\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed issues to Elon Musk, arguing that the recent surge of \"unhinged\" hate speech and coordinated attacks against Europe on X (formerly Twitter) is jeopardizing the very future of free speech. Following a €120 million fine imposed on X by the European Commission for Digital Services Act violations—including issues with the paid verification system and lack of transparency—Buterin observed that discourse on the platform has shifted from policy debate to \"emotionally-manipulative misinformation.\"\n\nButerin expressed concern that Musk has turned the platform into a \"death star laser for coordinated hate sessions,\" specifically targeting European cities like London and delegitizing the EU. He argues that this behavior risks a massive global backlash against liberal values in the coming years. While acknowledging valid criticisms of EU bureaucracy and surveillance, Buterin maintains that X’s current trajectory—where algorithms are \"arbitrarily\" tweaked to boost rage over civility—is a structural risk to democratic values.\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin proposed two primary solutions:\n\n* Algorithmic Transparency: Disclosing optimization targets so users understand what the platform is promoting and why.\n* On-Chain Verification: Using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and time-stamping decisions on-chain to make the algorithm more transparent and less susceptible to manual manipulation or censorship.\n\nUltimately, Buterin views the survival of a unified, reformed Europe as a vital global model and fears that Musk’s \"personal vendetta\" against EU regulators is weaponizing the platform in a way that will eventually lead to the destruction of the free speech principles Musk claims to defend.",

      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

The question is: Is this 40% surge the start of a new rally, or are old players looking for buyers at these high levels?\n\nI'm a bit conflicted myself:\n\nOn one hand, you can never underestimate the “madness” of this stock using traditional logic;\n\nOn the other hand, chasing it at these levels easily turns you into the “last one holding the bag.”\n\nSo I'd love to hear your thoughts\n\nDo you see any worthwhile opportunities here?\n\nIs this a short term bet, an event driven play, or have you completely written off stocks like this?",

Just sit it out like Buffett or just put some money in the S&amp;P 500 and that's it. Save it for \"good times\" which are the opposite for \"normal\" investors.\n\n**\"This stock went up 700%, is this stock good?\"**\n\nIf the only value you see is that the stock went up by 700%+, that's not value investing...\n\n**\"Should I buy Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, XYZ?\"**\n\nWhat about you do your own DD and stay in your area of competence. If you don't know why a stock went up, you won't understand why it goes down...\n\nYou should know when a company is undervalued and when it's overpriced.\n\n**\"I bought a stock one month ago, it went down 5%, should I sell?\"**\n\nIf you truly did your DD and you are a value investor, you just sit it out. You have time; you bought to hold it for years. I have stocks in my portfolio for over 10 years...\n\nI could go on and on and on, like trimming your portfolio every month, just looking at the numbers and not understanding the company, etc., etc., etc.!\n\n  \n**\"This stock dipped 30% everybody all in\"** \n\nI heard this story 100s times, I always ask, what makes you believe that it will go up again ? If you dont have a good answer dont buy! \n\n  \n\n\nIt's not that difficult to be a value investor. All you need is:\n\n**Benjamin Graham - The Intelligent Investor**\n\nMake sure you truly understand it, I needed time to understand it fully! If you are too lazy to read one book, you probably don't have the discipline to be a value investor.\n\nBonus: If this book is to \"difficult\" (no shame in that, I started very very slow) start with Peter Lynch + Youtube New Money.\n\nMost of you have the knowledge but some here either dont understand Valueinvesting or simply dont have the dispcpline and try to chase quick returns.\n\nEverything I do isnt based on my \"opinion\" or community posts its based on the tools of people who 100x smarter than me like Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham etc.\n\nWith these tools I try to find \"gaps\" in the marked and thats it. Sometimes it takes years sometimes only month. I have time!",

Buffett will be particularly missed at a time when many of the most successful people in the business community seem single-mindedly focused on making money, without reflecting much on the way they make it or what they will do with it. Just because you *can* doesn’t mean you *should*.\n\nMakes me a little sad that I got interested in this topic this year, at the tail of end Buffett's career. \n\n",

You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Friday.",

The Christmas rally may be quietly approaching.\n\n* NVDA: Buy on dips, await bullish reversal.\n* MSFT: Trading within a range; consider going long only after it returns to 490.\n* AMZN: First stop-loss level at 220, second stop-loss level at 210.\n* AAPL: Look to 276. Only a break above 276 signals an upward trend.\n* GOOG: Faces resistance at 305. Look for a rebound near 310 to turn bullish; otherwise, remain bearish.\n* META: Wait for a pullback near 660 to confirm new support before going long.\n* TSLA: Facing strong resistance at 490, unable to boost valuation.

      "content": "TikTok avoids ban with majority US-owned entity\n\nTikTok and ByteDance just signed binding agreements with a US investor group including Oracle Silver Lake and MGX to form a new US joint venture for TikTok’s US operations. The new entity is expected to be majority US owned, with ByteDance keeping about 19.9 percent, and the deal is targeted to close by Jan 22 2026. (related news source if you’re interested: [Oracle-Led Group Takes 45% Stake in TikTok US](https://www.moneyai-app.com/share/session?shareUuid=b0ce56e8-ac96-4ced-a4fd-e73f82cbf11f))\n\nA lot of people read this as ByteDance being forced into survival mode. From a capital markets lens, it looks more like they’re taking an asset that’s been trading at a long running geopolitical discount and repackaging it into something that can be priced, financed, and eventually exited.\n\nThat’s the real point of the structure. Wall Street can live with compliance costs, but it struggles to underwrite a political black box. A US led entity with clearer governance and auditability is basically a cleaner wrapper around the same cash flow engine.\n\nI’m not saying this means “IPO soon.” But it does make an IPO or partial listing feel less like a meme and more like a plausible option down the road, mainly because it creates a straightforward liquidity story for big US investors.\n\nThe part that matters most to me is TikTok Shop. Ads set the floor, commerce sets the ceiling. If discovery to purchase inside the feed keeps scaling, TikTok starts looking less like a social app and more like transaction infrastructure. If that holds under the new structure, the valuation conversation changes fast.",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

I mean the companies that produce the power, not the companies that buy it and sell it to consumers. \n\nFrom where I sit, Texas is the number one destination for these huge power hungry AI data centers.  There are by my calculations exactly 0 new power plants being built, for the most part the power companies are focusing on making them more efficient or expanding some but shovels breaking ground on new is zero and its been zero since Biden passed the build back act.  \n\nIn my opinion there is a pretty clear reasons why none have gotten off the ground, they have long build times and there are countless ways that they can be derailed.  \n\nThe reason for Texas is that they have a unique power grid that allows for open market bidding on power and its not meaningfully connected to the eastern or western part of the US grid.    \n\nIf my thesis is correct that data centers will require a huge amount of power, can be put up very quickly, have vast resources to bid on the open market and no new power sources are coming online for at least 10 years, the premium that the producers of power in Texas will be able to charge is going to go up significantly.

On that same day, 8 executives/directors executed stock sales under 10b5-1 plans.

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORT**\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 07:32:03 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT: CAUTIOUSLY BEARISH WITH POCKETS OF SPECULATION**\nThe overall sentiment is a tug-of-war between **macroeconomic anxiety** and **retail-driven speculative fervor**. Institutional and news flow points to caution (rising yields, debt concerns, housing data skepticism), while Reddit's retail cohort shows intense focus on meme stocks, crypto-mining windfalls, and conspiracy theories around economic data. The VIX at 16.87 suggests moderate, but not panicked, near-term volatility expectations. The tone is **not decisively bullish**; it's fragmented and risk-aware.\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES**\n\n*   **Macroeconomic Distrust & Data Skepticism:** A dominant theme. Reddit threads heavily question CPI/housing inflation data (#4, #10), while mainstream news notes a \"deep slump\" in housing. Combined with soaring national debt concerns (#13), this creates a backdrop of institutional and retail skepticism toward official economic narratives.\n*   **Central Bank Policy Pivot (Japan Focus):** The **Bank of Japan's historic rate hike** and the 10-year JGB yield crossing 2% (#1, #14) is a seismic global macro event. This signals the end of an era of ultra-loose Japanese policy, potentially triggering repatriation flows and increasing global yield pressure.\n*   **Retail Meme Stock & Speculative Revival:** **$GME** is prominently back in discussion (#2, #7), alongside stories of extreme options losses (#6) and crypto mining gains (#9). This indicates a resurgence of the high-risk, narrative-driven trading that typifies retail sentiment, often detached from fundamentals.\n*   **Tech Sector Volatility & Event-Driven Moves:** News highlights tech volatility driven by data center debates and a **massive options expiry (\"Witching Day\")** (#11). **Oracle's (+5% AH)** deal with TikTok (#15) is a specific, positive catalyst. Apple buyback criticism (#8) also draws retail attention.\n*   **Political & Fiscal Overhang:** Discussions around Trump Media's merger (#5), Trump's price claims (#12), and the Treasury's debt management (#3) tie market movements to political and fiscal developments, adding another layer of uncertainty.\n\n### **3. CRITICAL MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n\n*   **Primary Catalyst (Today): Record Options Expiry (\"Witching\").** This is the single most important technical event for the day (#11, News #4). It will likely cause elevated volatility, especially in large-cap tech and index ETFs, as dealers unwind massive hedges.\n*   **Key Macro Signal: Global Yield Re-pricing.** The **BoJ hike** and rising JGB yields are a major signal. This could strengthen the Yen (pressuring Yen carry trades) and add upward pressure on U.S. Treasury yields (already at 4.16%), challenging equity valuations.\n*   **Contrarian Sentiment Signal: Retail's GME Focus.** The intense Reddit discussion on GME, including a suspect $406 price listing on Google, is a classic signal of frothy, distracted retail sentiment. This often coincides with or precedes rotations away from speculative assets.\n*   **Sector Signal: Tech Resilience vs. Macro Headwinds.** News indicates tech is leading the market higher (#4) despite the macro concerns. Oracle's deal is a micro example. Watch if tech can decouple from rising rate fears today.\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n\n| **Primary Risks**                                                                 | **Potential Opportunities**                                                                 |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **1. Volatility Spike:** \"Triple witching\" expiry could cause sharp, unpredictable swings in major indices and tech names. | **1. Volatility Premium:** Elevated VIX and event-driven vol supports option selling strategies for income. |\n| **2. Yield Shock Spillover:** Accelerating rise in global yields (U.S. & Japan) could trigger a rapid de-valuation of long-duration assets (growth tech). | **2. Beneficiaries of Higher Rates:** Financials (banks) may see improved net interest margin narratives. |\n| **3. Retail Speculation Blow-off:** A sharp reversal in meme stocks could create negative sentiment spillover into broader retail-favored sectors. | **3. Thematic Pairs Trade:** Long stable, cash-flow positive value sectors vs. short speculative, profitless tech/meme stocks. |\n| **4. Data Credibility Crisis:** Growing distrust in economic data (CPI, housing) may lead to heightened sensitivity to any data miss, increasing volatility. | **4. Event-Driven Plays:** M&A and specific partnership news (e.g., **ORCL**) can provide isolated alpha opportunities. |\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n\n*   **SECTOR: TECHNOLOGY** – **Expect elevated volatility today.** Monitor large-cap tech (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA) for unusual volume and price action due to options expiry. **ORCL** has a clear positive catalyst; watch for follow-through.\n*   **SYMBOL: /ZN (10-Year Treasury Note Futures)** – **Watch for selling pressure.** The BoJ move and persistent U.S. debt concerns are bearish catalysts for bonds. A break above 4.20% on the 10Y yield could accelerate selling.\n*   **SECTOR: FINANCIALS (XLF/KRE)** – **Consider a tactical long bias.** Banks typically benefit from a steeper yield curve and higher rates. The macro narrative is shifting in their favor.\n*   **ACTION: VOLATILITY MANAGEMENT** – **Reduce leverage and widen stops today.** The witching expiry is a known volatility event. Avoid initiating large, directional equity positions at the open.\n*   **SYMBOL: GME & Meme Basket** – **High risk, monitor for sentiment peak.** Retail focus is intense. This is a sentiment, not fundamental, trade. Any failure to rally on this attention could lead to a sharp reversal. **Not for investment; trade with extreme caution.**\n*   **MACRO: USD/JPY** – **Watch for Yen strength.** The BoJ hike is fundamentally Yen-positive. A sustained break below 147 could signal the start of a larger unwind of the carry trade, impacting global asset flows.\n\n---\n**BOTTOM LINE:** The market faces a **technical volatility event (witching)** atop a **shifting global macro landscape (BoJ)**. While tech shows resilience, the undercurrents of yield pressure and data skepticism are strong. **Tactical caution is warranted.** Prioritize capital preservation over aggression today. The most actionable plays are in rate-sensitive sectors and specific event-driven names, not in chasing retail speculation.",

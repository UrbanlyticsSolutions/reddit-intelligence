      "content": "This is why it's so important to \"wait for the fat pitch\" as Buffett and Munger always used to say\n\nHello,\n\nThis post is inspired by the many posts I've seen over the last 2 years where investors keep arguing that you're better off investing in the S&amp;P500 even at a Shiller PE of 40 because \"time in the market is better than timing the market.\"\n\nThat comment makes sense most of the time except at the extremes. If you had invested in the Nikkei index in 1989 and held tenaciously for 35 years... you'd... have made 0%. Same goes for the S&amp;P500 for various long stretches, sometimes for over a decade like the 1965-1982 period or from 2000-2013.\n\nNow, since some people will say that I'm deliberately cherry picking periods but I wanted to present simple math that will give you a better idea of why Buffett and many other value investors prefer to sit on a cash pile for years and do nothing instead of dollar-cost-averaging like people have been taught to do.\n\n**Scenario A**: You buy the index at a Shiller PE of 40 (which it's currently at). You have 9 years of 10% gains on average and on the 10th it gets cut to a Shiller PE of 15 which is the long-term average. If you invest $100 at the beginning period you end up with $88.42. You were better off just putting that money in the bank.\n\n**Scenario B**: You buy mediocre treasuries yielding 3% and wait for good opportunities. You spend 9 years getting a pathetic 3% return and finally invest in the 10th year. You start with $100 and you end up with $130.47 at the start of year 10 and can invest the money at lower multiples.\n\nDo you see why Buffett is holding cash now ?\n\nIn investing we don't have to swing if the opportunity is not attractive.",

      "content": "Musk wins appeal and restores 2018 Tesla pay deal worth $56 billion\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Delaware's Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package from Tesla, which was once valued at $56 billion. Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.”\n\nThe ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction.\n\nThis compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November.\n\nThe ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares.\n\nMusk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock.\n\nIn 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded.\n\nMusk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies.\n\nTesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands.\n\nIn November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales.\n\nTesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan.\n\nThe Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.",

      "content": "US debt nightmare - the Fed is a hostage to the Treasury\n\nThe US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the entire value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined.\n\nThe total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We have entered a \"Fiscal Death Spiral\" where the US must borrow money simply to pay interest on previous debt. This creates even more debt and worsens the cycle.\n\nThe Fiscal Reality:\nThe math is simple but the politics are impossible. To fix the deficit, the government would have to:\n\nCut Entitlements or Defense: Political suicide.\n\nRaise Taxes Significantly: Economically impossible. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, every single taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in federal taxes.\n\nWith no plan to balance the books, the Treasury has one clear mandate: push for lower rates and QE. Reducing the interest burden is the only way for the government to remain solvent, even if it means sparking the next wave of inflation.\n\nThe Real Return Trap:\nThe market, not just the Fed, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation rises to or above current yields, bondholders face 0% or negative real returns.\n\nTo protect their real returns, bond investors will demand higher yields to stay ahead of rising prices. This spikes the cost of borrowing for the entire economy. It hits mortgages, corporate loans, and business expansion regardless of Fed policy.\n\nThe Slower Growth Reality:\nThis rising cost of capital directly hurts the consumer. Since consumer spending drives nearly 70% of US GDP, this creates a massive drag on the economy. We should expect slower growth as the burden of debt servicing eats into the \"fun money\" that usually fuels expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift yet.\n\nThe Coming Shift:\nAs the \"Risk-Free\" status of US Treasuries comes into question, capital will seek survival. We are approaching a point where investors will rotate away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of markets with more manageable debt levels.\n\nMoving before the majority accepts this reality might be the only sensible choice for protecting your wealth.\n\nRead [the full article](https://open.substack.com/pub/mathiasgraabeck/p/us-debt-nightmare?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay&amp;r=27oh3p) for a deep dive and recommendations",

I’m especially interested in content that goes beyond mechanics and focuses on **how great investors think** about businesses, valuation, and capital allocation.\n\nI really enjoy long-form, thoughtful analysis like Ben Thompson’s *Stratechery* — clear frameworks, business model breakdowns, and well-reasoned opinions — and I’m hoping to find something similar that’s **specifically focused on value investing**.\n\nI’m open to free or paid blogs, newsletters, or investor letters with a strong fundamentals and long-term orientation. Less interested in short-term market commentary or opaque stock-picking services.\n\nIf there are any consistently high-signal writers or platforms you’d recommend, I’d love to hear them.",

I assume this is due to discounts resulting from large issuances this year for infrastructure and technological investments.\n\nA 20 year Meta bond with 19 year call protection is trading today at a yield of 5.72% (CUSIP 30303M8X3) while a Pepsico bond with less credit quality (A1/A+) and 19 year call protection trades at a yield of 5.14% (713448CZ9).\n\nIf you are bullish on the AI industry but not wanting to buy equity at these high multiples, these may be compelling bond yields to lock in. You can lock in 5.72% annually or you may end up sitting on a large capital gain if rates come down in the next decade.\n\nJust an FYI. Do your own research and form your own opinions. These bonds would likely be best suited in a retirement account due to the federal, state, and local tax implications.",

Mainly because I'm still young and am looking at a 20 years horizon. I also work in tech so I have more exposure to tech sectors and better understanding of the risks.\n\nI know there are overlap and I'm fine with that. My question would be is there any other growth option that pair well with VWRA? ",

I don't know if this is old news or if this is something that might be the next sector that is trending other than semiconductors. In my opinion I think the tech side is slowing down and only so much can be innovated when it comes to GPUs, Semis, we are now seeing RAM prices go up with data centers being built. But with data centers being built rumor has it the US power grid can barely keep up with winter (Texas / Illinois specifically) and black outs in summer. \n\nI was eyeing a few energy stocks ($BE, FSLR, GEV, BESF ETF) but I was wondering if these are already priced in? Is energy sector something that is lacking or can money be made in this sector? \n\nI think FSLR will be slower as solar can only do so much. $BE might be the way to go, GEV looks like it has amazing potential and BESF ETF too but I don't have the data on whats comprised in that ETF. (FINVIZ Subscription ran out)\n\n$BE also crashed with the rumor when SPACE X goes public they will put data centers in space, but the argument is space is cold and imo that idea is far fetched just to get Space X in the spot light. \n\nA month ago I was eyeing data center construction stocks but now with the US infrastructure I think energy might be the next trending sector?

On that same day, 8 executives/directors executed stock sales under 10b5-1 plans. I understand the same-day execution is plausibly explained by price-based triggers or limit orders.\n\nHowever, I saw that the 8 plans that executed on December 8 were initiated in two clusters:\n\n* 3 plans on March 13, 2025\n* 5 plans on August 6, 2025\n\nI pulled Form 4 data for Wave from 2024–2025 to look closer at this pattern and wrote up the details here [https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/](https://rxdatalab.com/research/wave-life-sciences-insiders/)\n\nMy question:  \nI'm relatively new to this. Is this kind of clustered 10b5-1 adoption and execution fairly typical in biotech or other industries? Is this easily explained by compensation cycles/normal planning, or is this something you’d flag as worth a second look? \n\nI haven't yet benchmarked against a larger sample of biotech companies, that's on my list if this is indeed notable.",

Now I find myself in a position where a large percentage of my portfolio is in this single security and I'm looking to diversify.\n\nI have been told that enhanced direct indexing is a good option for unwinding a concentrated position. I'm a novice here but if I understand it correctly, for a non-trivial fee, a management firm will use my concentrated position as leverage to buy long and short positions and use tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains, effectively diversifying while deferring the large taxable event.\n\nAre there big inherent risks I'm not aware of? Are there other options I should consider? I recognize there's a real risk by having nearly half of my portfolio in a single security but I don't want to make a mistake and take an even greater risk trying to unwind it. \n\nThanks!",

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "## **Comprehensive Market Intelligence Analysis**\n**Time Horizon:** Day | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-19 15:32:04  \n**Overall Market Sentiment:** **Neutral-to-Cautiously Bearish** with high retail skepticism and macro uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### **1. MARKET SENTIMENT**\n- **Reddit Sentiment (Retail):** Overwhelmingly skeptical and defensive. Dominant themes include distrust of economic data (\"wacky number\" on housing inflation), warnings of extreme media \"FUD,\" and concerns over fiscal policy (national debt, intergenerational wealth transfer). The mention of a record \"Witching Day\" suggests heightened awareness of volatility from options expiry. Sentiment is **bearish** but fragmented—focused on specific narratives (GameStop, data skepticism) rather than broad market direction.\n- **Institutional/News Sentiment:** Mixed but leaning cautious. Bloomberg headlines highlight structural shifts (AI spending, emerging market cycles, oil oversupply) rather than immediate bullish catalysts. The note on \"noisy\" data aligns with Reddit's skepticism, suggesting a broader uncertainty in economic indicators.\n- **Technical/Macro Data:** The VIX at 16.87 is elevated but not panicked. The 10Y yield at 4.12% and Japan's yield crossing 2% (per Reddit) signal tightening global financial conditions. Equity risk premium of 4.33% is moderate, indicating neither strong risk appetite nor severe risk-off.\n- **Verdict:** Neutral-bearish bias. Retail is defensive, institutions are cautious, and macro pressures (yields, debt) are headwinds.\n\n---\n\n### **2. KEY THEMES**\n- **Data Distrust & Macro Skepticism:** Both Reddit and Bloomberg (\"Data Is Very Noisy\") highlight skepticism toward official economic data, especially inflation metrics. Reddit posts explicitly question housing inflation assumptions.\n- **Fiscal & Debt Concerns:** Reddit emphasizes the $38 trillion debt and its intergenerational impact. This is a growing undercurrent that could pressure long-term growth assets.\n- **AI as a Capital Allocation Driver:** Bloomberg notes AI as the \"largest spend item for 2026\" and Disney-OpenAI's deal. This remains a dominant investment theme.\n- **Volatility & Event Risk:** \"Witching Day\" (quadruple options expiry) and the FTC investigation into Collectors Holdings point to event-driven volatility.\n- **Retail Nostalgia/Meme Dynamics:** GameStop remains a cultural reference point (\"could be going to $0\"), indicating lingering meme stock influence but fading momentum.\n\n---\n\n### **3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS**\n- **Immediate Catalyst (Today):** Record options expiry (\"Witching Day\")—expect elevated volatility, especially in heavily traded names and indices.\n- **Bond Market Signal:** Japan's 10Y yield >2% (first in 15+ years) is a **major macro signal**. It suggests global yield normalization is accelerating, which could drain liquidity from risk assets.\n- **Commodity Signal:** Oil poised to fall further (per Bloomberg) due to oversupply. This is disinflationary but also reflects weak global demand expectations.\n- **Credit Stress Signal:** New Fortress Energy's delinquent payments (Bloomberg) highlight rising credit risks in high-yield segments amid high rates.\n- **IPO Market Signal:** \"Bigger IPOs are coming in 2026\" suggests capital markets are expected to reopen, which could absorb liquidity later.\n\n---\n\n### **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**\n- **Primary Risks:**\n  1. **Liquidity Drain:** Rising global yields (U.S. 10Y at 4.12%, Japan >2%) threaten valuation support for equities.\n  2. **Data Credibility Crisis:** Growing distrust in economic data could amplify volatility if revisions occur.\n  3. **Event Volatility:** Options expiry and regulatory actions (e.g., FTC investigation) create near-term unpredictability.\n  4. **Fiscal Overhang:** Debt servicing costs ($1 trillion annually) may limit fiscal stimulus and weigh on long-term growth expectations.\n- **Opportunities:**\n  1. **AI Infrastructure:** Continued corporate AI investment (per Teneo CEO) supports tech hardware, cloud, and semiconductor sectors.\n  2. **Emerging Markets:** Bloomberg notes a potential \"bull cycle\" starting—selective EM exposure may benefit if the dollar weakens.\n  3. **Disinflation Trade:** Falling oil prices could relieve pressure on consumer sectors, though it may also signal demand weakness.\n\n---\n\n### **5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS**\n- **SECTOR: Technology (AI/Infrastructure)** – Focus on companies enabling AI deployment (semiconductors, cloud, utilities). The Disney-OpenAI deal and corporate spending plans are tailwinds.  \n- **SECTOR: Emerging Markets** – Consider selective exposure to EMs entering a potential bull cycle, but hedge against dollar strength and global liquidity tightness.  \n- **SYMBOL: NVDA** – Up 3.93% today, likely benefiting from AI spending narrative. Monitor for continuation post-options expiry, but be wary of overextension.  \n- **SYMBOL: GLD** – Gold at $399.02 (GLD) may see bids if yield spikes cause equity volatility or data distrust escalates. A hedge against macro uncertainty.  \n- **ACTION: Reduce High-Beta, Low-Liquidity Positions** – Ahead of witching volatility and amid rising yields, trim speculative retail favorites (e.g., meme stocks, small caps like LAZR/PRPH showing extreme moves).  \n- **WATCH: 10Y Treasury Yield & Japanese JGBs** – Further rises above 4.12% (U.S.) or sustained >2% (Japan) could trigger broad risk-off moves.  \n- **AVOID: Heavy Oil Longs** – Bloomberg's oversupply warning suggests energy sector headwinds persist.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** The market is in a cautious holding pattern with a bearish tilt due to macro pressures and data skepticism. Prioritize quality (AI infrastructure, selective EMs) and defensiveness (gold, liquidity). Today's options expiry amplifies near-term noise—avoid impulsive trades. Monitor bond yields as the primary signal for broader risk appetite shifts.",

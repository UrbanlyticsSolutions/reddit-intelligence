      "content": "Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting has just concluded, leaving the market with several intriguing signals.\n\nToday, Microsoft shareholders formally approved all company proposals, including board elections and the 2026 stock plan.\n\nBut more notably shareholders rejected all six shareholder proposals, including one demanding Microsoft submit a “human rights due diligence report.”\n\nThis raises several questions:\n\nAmid AI's sweeping expansion, Microsoft increasingly resembles a “state-owned enterprise among tech giants.” Yet shareholders have clearly granted the company greater autonomy this time.\n\nFrom a purely market perspective, this outcome is almost entirely positive for the stock price, as the company avoids being shackled by additional regulatory reporting requirements.\n\nYet from a long-term ESG and social responsibility perspective, won't this become a latent concern for Microsoft? Especially as tensions escalate around sensitive areas like OpenAI, AI regulation, and data ethics.\n\nMy personal take: This vote feels more like the market collectively saying, “Keep driving performance we don't want distractions.”\n\nBut as AI operations expand, whether such proposals resurface remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs this a rational market choice, or is it merely deferring potential long-term risks?\n\nI'm particularly curious to hear others' perspectives on Microsoft's positioning under AI regulatory pressure over the next 1–3 years.",

      "title": "Clean energy isn’t failing. It’s threatening the people who built fortunes on scarcity.",
      "content": "Clean energy isn’t failing. It’s threatening the people who built fortunes on scarcity.\n\nMost people are reading the clean energy sector completely wrong.  \n  \nThey look at red charts, crushed valuations, and ugly sentiment and think:  \n\"See, it was all hype. The tech doesn’t work. The economics don’t add up.\"  \n  \nNo. The tech works. The physics work. The economics work.  \nWhat doesn’t work anymore is the old power structure built on scarcity.\n\n# 1. Oil survives on scarcity. Clean energy survives on abundance.\n\nOil is valuable because it is limited.  \n  \nYou can control supply.  \nYou can restrict access.  \nYou can manipulate flows and influence pricing.  \n  \nThat model has fed entire dynasties, countries, and corporate empires for decades.  \n  \nClean energy is the opposite.  \n  \nYou cannot corner the sun.  \nYou cannot own the wind.  \nYou cannot put a fence around photons.  \n  \nAs you scale solar, wind, storage, and smarter grids, you move closer to something energy markets are not built to handle: practical abundance. When a resource moves toward abundance, long term prices tend to trend down and control shifts away from those who used scarcity as leverage.  \n  \nThat does not threaten the technology.  \nIt threatens the business model that ruled the last century.\n\n# 2. Old money versus new players\n\nThis is not a morality play. It is a capital structure problem.  \n  \nOil money has had decades to dig into governments, regulators, media, and financial systems.  \nNew clean energy companies are still building basic profitability and scale. They do not have the same lobbying power or political weight.  \n  \nSo when you see pressure on clean energy stocks, it is not just \"the market is disappointed.\" It is also the inertia of old capital defending its territory.  \n  \nOld money is not going to roll over because the physics improved.\n\n# 3. Why clean energy stocks all look the same on the chart\n\nPeople say:  \n\"If this sector is the future, why do all these charts look like trash?\"  \n  \nBecause the market is not just pricing tech. It is pricing resistance.  \n  \nThe closer we move toward widespread clean energy adoption, the more direct the threat to those who rely on controlled scarcity. That resistance does not target one company. It hits the entire sector.  \n  \nSo the charts move together.  \n  \nMass rerates up when optimism spikes.  \nThen mass punishment when pressure comes back in.  \nRinse, repeat.  \n  \nYou are not just watching fundamentals. You are watching a power struggle reflected in price action.\n\n# 4. The transition is inevitable, but not painless\n\nClean energy wins on the long timeline for one reason: it is better aligned with physics and long term economics.  \n  \nOnce the upfront buildout is done, a lot of the \"fuel\" is free.  \nSunlight does not send an invoice. Wind does not negotiate shipping rates.  \n  \nBut the speed of the transition is not decided only by engineers. It is decided by capital and policy.  \n  \nThat is why you can see:\n\n* The technology already working at scale in many regions\n* The costs already competitive or better\n* Yet the sector still trading like it is some failed experiment\n\nThere is a fight over how fast the old model gets dismantled.\n\n# 5. What this means for investors\n\nIf you look at clean energy names and only see “downtrend,” you are missing the bigger picture.  \n  \nYes, the sector is volatile.  \nYes, many companies will fail.  \nYes, a lot of garbage got funded along the way.  \n  \nBut at the structural level, you are dealing with a simple reality:\n\n* The old world is built on monetizing scarcity.\n* The new world is built on scaling abundance.\n\nThe economic winner is obvious over decades. The path there will not be smooth, especially when trillions in old capital are on the line.\n\nThis is not financial advice.  \nIt is a reminder that red charts do not automatically mean \"dead tech.\"  \n  \nSometimes they mean the future is colliding with people who have every reason to delay it.",

Since PCE is the Fed’s preferred gauge, this print will likely factor into next week’s meeting, where markets already expect another rate cut. Personal income rose 0.4% for the month, while spending increased 0.3%, a bit softer than forecast but still pointing to steady consumer activity. Overall, nothing shocking in the data just more signs that inflation is cooling, but not fast enough to fully remove uncertainty around policy.\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/pce-inflation-report-september-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/pce-inflation-report-september-2025.html)",

      "content": "Berkshire is on track to lag behind the S&amp;P 500 in Buffett's last year as CEO\n\nBerkshire Hathaway had a pretty interesting run this year, especially around the time Warren Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of the year. Before that surprise in early May, BRK.B was actually beating the S&amp;P 500 by a wide margin outperformance of over 22 percentage points in 2025.\nThat changed quickly after the announcement. Over the next three months, the stock slid nearly 15% to a low around $459 in early August. Since then, it’s bounced back about 10% and now sits near $504, putting it up roughly 11% for the year.\nThe problem is the broader market hasn’t slowed down. The S&amp;P 500 is up almost 38% since its April low and nearly 17% year-to-date, closing just a few points below its all-time high. Even with Berkshire’s rebound, it hasn’t been able to catch up with that pace. Feels like a year where the market is rewarding risk and momentum more than steady, conservative names. Curious how others see Berkshire here long-term hold as usual, or starting to fall behind in this kind of market?\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/06/berkshire-hathaway-is-on-track-to-lag-behind-the-sp-500-in-buffetts-last-year-as-ceo.html?__source=androidappshare\n\n",

      "content": "Google - not AMD - is Nvidia’s greatest threat because of their full-stack AI and AlphaEvolve\n\nAMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else, but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company’s conception. Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000: \n\n\"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we had the ultimate search engine, it would understand everything on the web; it would understand, um, you know, exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. And that's obviously artificial intelligence.\"[ Google Co-Founder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI (2000)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OT_Uj2z3Z0) \\- For those that don’t know, it was supposedly Larry Page’s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI.\n\n# Full-stack AI\n\nNow, imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation. Your first thought will probably be: Which should I pick? ChatGPT immediately comes to mind, but you want to do your research properly. Through your research, you find that Google's Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck, at least among American AI models. Plus, they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model. Perfect. Google seems like a good choice. Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity (especially if they improve).\n\nBut what about implementation? Google offers enterprise-ready API:s via Vertex with more features coming like auth, database and payments, Google Cloud for storage, and now even at location TPU:s that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible. Super. Suddenly, your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google, and along the way, you never touch an Nvidia product.\n\nBut before you make your final decision, you ask yourself: Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term, so I don’t get vendor-locked with an inferior offering?\n\nI’ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never want to bet against the man - and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way. I don’t imagine Nvidia is particularly - or really at all - threatened by Google in the short term, though Google's TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices, reducing profit margin. Apparently, OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it, according to[ Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1994468652716859394), worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia. Though what is actually important is not the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future.\n\n# AlphaEvolve\n\nI allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed[ AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/). The evolutionary AI system had, in secret, improved everything from the training of their AI models to Google's hardware, i.e., their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multi-billion dollar deal for them, with Meta considering the same. \n\nThe remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro, not even Gemini 2.5. Today, it’s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations, and in the future, it will use far more powerful models than that. Meaning that the better Google’s AI models get, the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google’s models and hardware. The cheaper and better Google’s hardware, the more powerful models can be built and run. The more powerful the models, the better the hardware. And so on.\n\nBetter AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia’s CUDA moat. One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code, causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA. But once AI models become sufficiently advanced, the programming difficulty may not be a concern, or Google and Gemini create some CUDA-variant of their own. Rumors also exist of them doing just that.\n\n# All in all\n\nThis means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business, it’s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia. If they do it often enough, AI labs will eventually wonder: can you build better AI models without Nvidia? This will be especially true if other AI-labs do it too:[ “resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs”](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/tpuv7-google-takes-a-swing-at-the).\n\nDoes this mean I think Nvidia is done for? Not at all, as I said, I've spent enough time studying Jensen that I'd never want to bet against him. After all, he is a man who roommated with a 17-year-old ex-con covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5-trillion-dollar man. Jensen has a ton of cards to play, and he’s already playing them perfectly.\n\nNvidia still has a hardware/hardware-software lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future. If they make a substantial compute leap, Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia’s AI lab, absorb one of the AI labs, or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race. He is securing long-term deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia. Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development. He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem. Nvidia will likely begin to offer full-stack solutions of its own. And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia, Google and AMD.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I hold a significant long position in Google (Alphabet). The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not constitute financial or investment advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.  \n  \n**TLDR;** Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term, though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin. But over the long term, Google’s full stack offerings - AI models/applications, cloud and TPUs - with AI model’s designed to improve AI models and hardware (AlphaEvolve) getting better, Google might even take a long term lead. Though, Jensen is playing Nvidia’s cards perfectly. ",

The report also mentions that an IPO could happen as soon as late 2026, though nothing is confirmed yet. Elon Musk has said before that he’s open to taking SpaceX public at some point, even though he’s also talked about the downsides of being a public company. For now, this secondary sale would mainly allow existing investors and employees to sell some shares while the company remains private. If this valuation holds, it would officially put SpaceX among the most valuable companies in the world without ever needing to ring the IPO bell (at least for now). Curious what people think: does SpaceX actually benefit from going public, or is staying private still the better move for a company like this?\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/spacex-aims-for-800b-valuation-in-secondary-share-sale-wsj-reports.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/spacex-aims-for-800b-valuation-in-secondary-share-sale-wsj-reports.html)",

I run DCF models on everything I buy. Spend probably an hour per company. But then I see other people post their intrinsic value estimates for the same stock and we're like 30% apart. Same company, wildly different conclusions.\n\nThe inputs matter so much more than the model. What growth rate? What discount rate? Terminal value? Change any slightly and your output swings massively.\n\nStarted using multiple methods and only getting interested when they converge. If DCF says one thing but Graham number says another I get skeptical. Been cross referencing my spreadsheets with valuesense lately just to sanity check myself.\n\nHow do you guys deal with this uncertainty? Do you accept wide ranges or have you found ways to narrow it down?",

The other 2 RAM companies, Samsung an SK Hyinx will also profit as a whole 1/3rd of their competition in the consumer RAM market disappears completely. The AI Bubble popping would be because AI companies can’t meet expectations, thus not making profits, causing the bubble to pop, or the market crash. But these RAM providers ARE meeting expectations by selling the hardware. If the crash occurs, how would their stocks drop, if they are making profits by selling hardware?\n\nNote: I’m a fairly new investor, so I may be way off the mark with this evaluation.

      "content": "Puts vs. inverse ETFs? A one year update on MSTR\n\nA year ago on Saturday, December 7, 2024, [I joined the chorus of skeptics in calling bullshit on MSTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h8me2c/best_way_to_establish_a_short_position_on_mstr/), which had closed the previous Friday (December 6, 2024) at 395.01. As I was 100% convinced it would go down, I wanted to figure how to establish a bearish position. Unfortunately, as a long-only investor, I had no experience in doing this, so I thought asked this subreddit how best to achieve this exposure.\n\n* Most of the posters called me crazy.\n* Some agreed with my thesis but advised me not to pursue this: they were right.\n* Some thought MSTR would continue to moon.\n* Some suggested inverse ETFs.\n* Some suggested puts.\n\nUltimately, I decided to sit this out. However, so that I could be prepared the next time an opportunity presented itself, I decided to follow the outcomes of various strategies I would have considered.\n\nAs you probably know, being bearish on a stock not only requires that you are directionally correct, but that you are on point with the timing as well because you otherwise get gaped by exorbitant interest (with shorts), volatility decay (with inverse ETFs), or theta decay (with options). To make sure I didn't cherry pick the perfect time points, I chose **exactly one year** (12/7/24 to 12/6/25) for each of these securities. For the put options, I chose one- and two-year January dated expirations with round numbers (all initial prices adjusted for reverse splits). Note that the specific options denoted in asterisk have extremely low volumes:\n\n|Ticker|Strategy|Position|Initial|Current|% Change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[MSTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR/)|Underlying Stock|Long|395.01|178.99|(-54.69%)|\n|[MSTZ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTZ/)|2x Inverse ETF|Short|19.06|13.02|(-31.69%)|\n|[SMST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SMST/)|2x Inverse ETF|Short|113.00|71.24|(-36.96%)|\n|[MSTR260116P00300000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR260116P00300000/)|Jan 2026 300p|Short|104.02|121.27|\\+16.58%|\n|[MSTR260116P00250000\\*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR260116P00250000/)|Jan 2026 250p|Short|74.30|72.81|(-2.01%)|\n|[MSTR260116P00200000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR260116P00200000/)|Jan 2026 200p|Short|49.65|30.71|(-38.15%)|\n|[MSTR270115P00300000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR270115P00300000/)|Jan 2027 300p|Short|132.00|144.05|\\+9.13%|\n|[MSTR270115P00250000\\*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR270115P00250000/)|Jan 2027 250p|Short|98.80|100.00|\\+1.21%|\n|[MSTR270115P00200000\\*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR270115P00200000/)|Jan 2027 200p|Short|69.09|67.20|(-2.74%)|\n\nAs you can see, I was **spectacularly right** that the price of MSTR would plummet. MSTR bagholders have had a miserable time (-55%). However, I would have also lost about 1/3 of my principle with inverse ETFs MSTZ or SMST, as they naturally \"sell low\" and \"buy high\" (the basis of their volatility decay).\n\nNote that even though MSTR has fallen below the strike price for all the options, the less initially OTM put options (300p) would have been positive whereas the 200p would have been in the red.\n\n**\"Why don't you short it?\"**\n\nIn the end, it pretty much never makes sense to short a stock, even one that is completely garbage. You get an average of 11% per year with much less risk just for indexing (which requires no conviction), &gt;20% in recent years. If you really have the ability to generate alpha--as one must suppose to justify a short position--you can presumably get much higher than &gt;20% annual returns.",

      "content": "Russia's Oil Revenue, India as a buyer, and US leverage\n\nHi redditors, I came across an article called *The Geometry of Dependency* that sketches how energy flows are quietly rewriting the map of power. It looks at Russia selling cut-rate oil to India, India using that discount to hedge its future, and the United States trying to keep its weight in the system through sanctions and trade pressure. You see the outlines of a world where energy isn’t just fuel but a way of shaping how states move, who they rely on, and how far their autonomy can stretch.\n\nCurious what you think: are we watching the early shape of new alliances forming, or is this just another cycle in a system that ultimately bends back toward U.S. influence?",

In addition, it owns $30 million worth of SEALSQ shares, has a contract with the Swiss Army and foresees revenues doubling next year. The company has no long term debt. The market cap is $100 million. And they also own Wisekey SAT space which they plan to spin off as a seperate company- it will IPO at a $250 million market cap. So $224 million cash, $30 million worth of LAES shares and $250 million ownership of Wisekey.SAT which release satellites into space protected by quantum cybersecurity.

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-06 07:02:13 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Neutral to Cautiously Bearish**\n- **Reddit Sentiment:** Mixed but leaning negative. High engagement on posts about job cuts (+183% in October), retail trading losses (\"-75k over 5 years\"), and skepticism around market events (CVNA added to S&P). However, positive engagement on lower-than-expected core inflation (2.8%) suggests relief on Fed policy.\n- **Macro Data:** Contradictory signals. Core inflation cooling (bullish) but job cuts surging and unemployment at 4.4% (bearish). VIX at 15.78 indicates moderate fear but not panic.\n- **Conclusion:** Sentiment is bifurcated—institutional relief on inflation data vs. retail anxiety over employment and personal losses. Overall tone is cautious.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES\n- **Inflation & Fed Policy:** Dominant theme. \"Core inflation rate watched by Fed hit 2.8%\" is the top Reddit topic. Lower inflation supports potential dovish Fed pivot, a key market driver.\n- **Labor Market Deterioration:** \"US job cuts surged 183% in October\" (Reddit) contrasts with strong Canadian jobs data. This creates uncertainty about economic resilience.\n- **Retail Trader Distress:** Multiple Reddit posts highlight significant losses and frustration (\"-75k over 5 years\", \"Another 200 down the drain\"), indicating a strained retail cohort.\n- **Mega-Cap & Speculative Moves:** SpaceX valuation talks ($800B) and CVNA's S&P addition (met with skepticism) point to continued focus on high-growth, high-valuation stories.\n- **Sector-Specific News:** Pharma (Teva vs. Pfizer), data centers (CoreWeave profitability), and satellite tech (AST SpaceMobile drop) show stock-specific volatility.\n\n## 3. IMPORTANT MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n- **Primary Catalyst:** **Inflation Data Surprise.** September core CPI at 2.8% (lower than expected) is a major positive macro catalyst that could ease financial conditions.\n- **Contradictory Signal:** **Rising Job Cuts.** Record 153K job cuts in October against a backdrop of 4.4% unemployment suggests the labor market may be cracking, posing a recession risk.\n- **Technical Signal:** **VIX at 15.78.** Elevated but not extreme, suggesting traders are hedging but not expecting imminent crisis.\n- **Flow Signal:** **Retail Capitulation.** Reddit sentiment shows exhaustion and loss-taking, which can sometimes mark a contrarian bottom for beaten-down names.\n- **Valuation Signal:** **SpaceX $800B talks.** Highlights continued investor appetite for disruptive tech, but at extreme valuations, raising sustainability questions.\n\n## 4. PRIMARY RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES\n- **Risks:**\n    1. **Labor Market Shock:** Surging job cuts could translate into weaker consumer spending, threatening earnings.\n    2. **Retail Liquidation:** Further retail capitulation could pressure meme/speculative stocks (e.g., GME mentioned).\n    3. **Geopolitical & Sector Shifts:** China's growing scientific clout (per Reddit) hints at long-term tech competition risks.\n- **Opportunities:**\n    1. **Dovish Fed Pivot:** Lower inflation data opens door for rate cuts sooner than expected, benefiting growth stocks.\n    2. **Contrarian Plays:** Extreme retail pessimism (e.g., on CVNA) may create oversold bounces if fundamentals surprise.\n    3. **Defensive Rotation:** Stocks with stable earnings (e.g., WMT mentioned in RSS) may attract flows if recession fears grow.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n**Watch These Catalysts & Positions:**\n\n- **MACRO: Watch Jobs vs. Inflation.** Monitor next jobs report for confirmation of weakness. If job cuts continue but inflation stays low, Fed may cut despite decent unemployment, creating a bullish setup for bonds and tech.\n- **SECTOR: Data Centers & AI Infrastructure.** **CoreWeave** hitting profitability while **Applied Digital** burns cash (per RSS) signals a bifurcation—focus on profitable players in high-demand infrastructure.\n- **SYMBOL: NVDA.** Trading at $182.41 (-0.53%). As an AI bellwether, it will be sensitive to both Fed policy (growth) and retail sentiment. A break above $185 could signal renewed institutional buying.\n- **SYMBOL: WBD.** Up 6.28% to $26.08. Check for catalyst (earnings/news). Such a move on a large cap warrants scrutiny—could be a value rotation play.\n- **SYMBOL: IRBT.** Surged 21.98% to $3.69. Likely a short squeeze or news-driven spike. Extreme volatility suggests high risk; avoid chasing.\n- **RISK: Avoid Retail Favorites Facing Liquidation.** High-loss Reddit mentions suggest pockets of retail selling pressure. Be cautious on meme stocks without earnings.\n- **OPPORTUNITY: Consider Dividend & Defensive Stocks.** If job data worsens, sectors like consumer staples (WMT), utilities, and healthcare may outperform.\n\n**Bottom Line:** The market is at a crossroads between cooling inflation (bullish) and a softening labor market (bearish). Position for volatility. Favor quality companies with strong balance sheets, and avoid chasing retail-driven pumps. The next major data point (jobs or CPI) will likely set the near-term direction.",

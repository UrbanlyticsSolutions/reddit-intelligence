      "content": "IBM CEO says there is 'no way' spending trillions on AI data centers will pay off at today's infrastructure costs\n\nArvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, has argued that the recent surge in spending by Big Tech on AI-data centers is economically unrealistic. On the “Decoder” podcast he estimated that building and fully outfitting a one-gigawatt AI data center costs about $80 billion. Given that industry announcements suggest firms are planning up to 100 gigawatts of compute capacity, the total capital expenditure could reach around $8 trillion, which would require roughly $800 billion in profits just to cover interest.  \n\n\nKrishna also highlighted that AI hardware like GPUs depreciates quickly and often needs to be replaced roughly every five years, which further undermines long-term financial returns. He said he believes the likelihood of achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI) with current technology is between zero and one percent, making the massive infrastructure bets more speculative than certain. \n\nStill, Krishna acknowledged the potential of today’s AI tools to deliver significant enterprise productivity gains. He cautioned that while infrastructure-heavy “AGI-race” spending may not pay off, more modest, business-focused AI deployments could still be worthwhile.\n\n[Link to article](https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-ceo-big-tech-ai-capex-data-center-spending-2025-12)",

      "content": "Is the entire stock market basically a giant confidence game and what happens the day people stop believing in it?\n\nHonestly I’ve been thinking about this way too much lately… sometimes the whole stock market feels like it only works because everyone keeps pretending it works. Like literally the whole thing runs on “confidence,” “sentiment,” “vibes,” whatever you wanna call it. Earnings matter yeah, interest rates matter yeah, but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it’s worth buying. People hold because they trust it’ll go back up. People panic because they think someone else is panicking.\n\nIt’s like one giant circular trust fall. Everyone is basically agreeing not to look down.\n\nAnd then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense? Like not a normal recession or correction, but a day where enough people say “nah I’m done trusting this casino.” Would everything just… unwind? Would indexes tank for years? Would governments step in and force something? Or does the system somehow survive because it’s too big to fail, like people will keep believing simply because they have no choice?\n\nIdk maybe I’m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is. Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating?",

      "content": "OpenAI declares ‘code red’ as Google catches up in AI race\n\nThe Verge, Dec 2, 2025\n\nGoogle’s own ‘code red’ response to ChatGPT has started paying off.\n\nThe tides are turning in the AI race, and the pressure is getting to OpenAI. Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in.\n\nIn the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said.\n\nThere will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development.\n\nThe newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.\n\nSource: https://www.theverge.com/news/836212/openai-code-red-chatgpt",

He frequently referenced the market being way too expensive consistently sitting at 20-25X earnings, and mentioned several times that the USA had reached its “apex” (peak) and indexes may not be wise investments as the nation may see prolonged stagnation in terms of growth and earnings — which is why he spent the last chapters of his life seeking value in China, which seemed to disappoint him just as many times as it helped him due to the strict corporate regulations and oversight. \n\nI know it’s just one grumpy old man’s opinion, but it’s very disheartening to see a man who went from bankrupt to billionaire in a little over 30 years, largely through marketable securities, almost blow off the future of investing. He stated numerous times that the upcoming generation should be ready for a lot of disappointment in the markets. \n\nThoughts?",

Their cloud unit just launched **Trainium3**, a new processor designed to run heavy AI model training at a lower cost and higher efficiency than Nvidia’s GPUs at least according to Amazon.\n\nThe pitch seems clear: companies want cheaper AI compute, and Nvidia’s pricing + demand backlog is still insane. If Amazon can offer decent performance for less, there’s definitely a market for it.\n\nBut there’s a catch.  \nTrainium3 doesn’t have anything close to Nvidia’s software ecosystem. CUDA and the entire Nvidia stack are still massive moats, and they’re the reason companies can deploy models quickly without rewriting everything. Amazon doesn’t have that luxury yet.\n\nIis Nvidia’s dominance still unshakeable because of the ecosystem lock-in or you think Amazon actually becomes a real competitor in AI hardware",

The people characterised the discussions as preliminary and informal, suggesting that the company was not close to picking its IPO underwriters.\n\nNonetheless, these moves represent a significant step up in Anthropic’s preparations for an IPO that would test the appetite of public markets to back the massive, lossmaking research labs at the heart of the AI boom.\n\nWilson Sonsini has advised Anthropic since 2022, including on multibillion-dollar investments from Amazon, and has worked on high-profile tech IPOs such as Google, LinkedIn and Lyft.\n\nIts investors are enthusiastic about an IPO, arguing that Anthropic can seize the initiative from its larger rival OpenAI by listing first.\n\nSources: FINANCIAL TIMES/ Reuter\n",

Its dependent on TSMCs ability to fabricate them. \n\nIn this inflationary speculative environment AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, are all given premium valuations with 40-120x pe and can still be considered fair value. TSMC is sitting at a \"healthy\" tech sector pe of anywhere around 28-30 day to day. They have a PEG of around 1, far better than AMD and is instep with NVIDA, and have operating margins on par with NVIDIA as well at 50%. Their revenues, margins, growth is exemplary and honestly criminally undervalued in such a inflationary AI environment. \n\nAre there any other reasons besides hostilities from China why TSMC hasnt gone side by side with Nvidia in growth?

      "content": "SoftBank trims Eutelsat stake, shares drop 7% what’s the real implication?\n\nEutelsat’s stock slipped around 7% this morning after reports surfaced that SoftBank reduced its stake in the company. Given SoftBank had been one of the more notable backers in the OneWeb–Eutelsat merger, the move naturally raised a few eyebrows. Eutelsat is still trying to position itself as a serious competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink, but scaling satellite broadband isn’t cheap, and investor sentiment has been shaky since the merger.A stake cut doesn’t necessarily mean SoftBank is abandoning the story they’ve been reshuffling exposure across different AI and connectivity bets lately but the timing does add pressure, especially when the company is already navigating heavy capex needs and slow commercial uptake compared to Starlink.",

      "content": "From superinvestor stalking to a 7-stock “tollbooth” watchlist – sanity check?\n\nHey all,\n\nI’ve been down a deep rabbit hole recently and would love a sanity check from this sub.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nI started by reverse-engineering long-term successful investors (Li Lu, Guy Spier, Terry Smith, Dev Kantesaria, Chris Hohn etc.), and ended up with a very concentrated, ultra long-term “tollbooth” watchlist built around 7 names: **Microsoft, Alphabet, Visa, Mastercard, S&amp;P Global, Moody’s, GE Aerospace.**\n\nAmbitious goal: something like high-teens IRR over 10–20 years, knowing these are already huge businesses. I’m not asking “should I buy now”, more “does this structure / logic make sense at all.”\n\n\n\n**Where this started: stalking superinvestors**\n\nI dug through public holdings / 13Fs / factsheets for:\n\n* **Li Lu (Himalaya)**\n* **Guy Spier (Aquamarine)**\n* **Terry Smith (Fundsmith)**\n* **Dev Kantesaria (Valley Forge)**\n* **Chris Hohn (TCI)**\n\nThen looked for overlaps and recurring patterns, not one-off high-conviction pet names.\n\nThemes that kept coming up:\n\n* **Payment networks** – Visa, Mastercard\n* **Credit/data “tollbooths”** – Moody’s, S&amp;P Global\n* **Big tech infra** – Microsoft, Alphabet\n* **Capital allocators / industrials** – Berkshire, Bank of America, GE Aerospace, some high-quality defense, etc.\n\nRough conclusion: these people with very different personalities seem to converge on:\n\n* Asset-light or capital-light,\n* High ROIC,\n* Pricing power and recurring revenue,\n* Long reinvestment runway,\n* Management actually returning cash (buybacks, not just dividends).\n\n\n\n**My current “tollbooth” list**\n\nRight now my short list for a concentrated, ultra long-term bucket is:\n\n1. **Microsoft (MSFT)** – enterprise / developer / productivity OS + Azure + AI infra\n2. **Alphabet (GOOGL)** – search + YouTube + ads + cloud + AI infra\n3. **Visa (V)** – global card network “tax” on nominal GDP and electronic payments\n4. **Mastercard (MA)** – similar model, slightly smaller, arguably a bit more agile / innovative\n5. **S&amp;P Global (SPGI)** – indices + ratings + market intelligence / commodity data\n6. **Moody’s (MCO)** – ratings + risk / analytics software for banks/insurers\n7. **GE Aerospace (GE)** – jet engines + long-duration service contracts (toll on flight hours)\n\nThe common thread I’m trying to capture:\n\n* High switching costs or network effects\n* Structural volume tailwinds (cloud, digital ads, cash→cards, bond/ETF markets, air travel)\n* Pricing power / inflation pass-through\n* Asset-light enough that a lot of incremental revenue turns into FCF\n* Willingness to retire shares over time\n\nBasically: own the pipes everyone else is forced to rent.\n\n\n\n**Reality check: 10x from here is probably fantasy**\n\nI did a rough “10x in 10–15 years” reverse-math exercise:\n\n* Take current market cap and net income\n* Assume a lower terminal multiple than today (not higher)\n* Solve for: “what EPS growth is needed to 10x the stock from here?”\n\nResult (very hand-wavy, but directionally):\n\n* For **MSFT / GOOGL / V / MA / SPGI / MCO**, you’re talking **20–30%+ EPS CAGR** for a decade from already massive bases.\n* That feels way too aggressive as a base case.\n* GE has a bit more room because it’s earlier in the aero upcycle / margin recovery, but still not small.\n\nSo I’ve mentally moved from “I want 10x” to something more like: *If these can collectively grow EPS in the low- to mid-teens, and I don’t overpay too much, and they keep retiring 2–3% of shares annually, maybe a* ***high-teens IRR*** *is on the table, with low blow-up risk.* \n\nThat’s the ambitious case. Realistic outcome probably closer to **10–15%** if things go reasonably well and multiples don’t completely collapse.\n\n\n\n**The duopoly question: do I really need both in each lane?**\n\nThis is one conceptual thing I’m still chewing on, and I’d love views from people who’ve actually held these for long periods.\n\nTwo obvious duopoly-ish lanes:\n\n* **Payments:** Visa *and* Mastercard\n* **Ratings:** S&amp;P Global *and* Moody’s\n\nMy current (tentative) thinking:\n\n* In payments, business models are almost identical. Owning both feels like a cheap hedge against me being over-confident about which sister outperforms, while still being very focused on the same underlying economics (card rails as a tax on nominal activity).\n* In ratings/data, SPGI and MCO actually have meaningfully different mixes:\n   * **SPGI:** big on indices (tax on passive), commodity data, plus ratings.\n   * **MCO:** more skewed to risk / analytics software and bank/insurance workflows. Owning both feels less like owning Coke &amp; Pepsi and more like owning different “toll booths” in the same city.\n\nBut I’m very open to the argument that this is just me chickening out of making harder choices.\n\n\n\n**What I’d love feedback on**\n\nTrying to keep this short:\n\n1. Does this 7-name “tollbooth” idea make sense at all as a long-term, high-moat compounding basket, or is this just closet indexing with extra steps?\n2. Are “high-teens IRR” aspirations from here just unrealistic given current valuations / sizes?\n   * What would *you* assume as a reasonable long-term return band for a basket like this if bought at \\~typical current multiples?\n3. On the duopoly question: would you personally own both V &amp; MA / both SPGI &amp; MCO, or would you force yourself to pick one in each lane? Why?\n4. Anything obvious missing from a global “tollbooth” theme that you think is strictly better than one of the names above (e.g. FICO, exchanges like NASDAQ/ICE/CME, certain software names, etc.)?\n\nAppreciate any thoughtful pushback.",

Oracle s 5 year CDS just spiked to about 128 bps, the highest since the financial crisis. For context, it was only 36 bps back in June.\n\n\n\nWhy the jump? A lot of investors seem to be getting nervous about the insane amount of debt being issued around the AI boom. Oracle alone has piled on tens of billions in new and project-backed debt over the past few months.\n\n\n\nSome strategists are saying the setup looks uncomfortably similar to past bubbles  massive capital flowing in, returns not keeping up, and credit risk quietly flashing red. Not saying it is 2000 all over again, but the parallels are getting harder to ignore.\n\n\n\nCurious what you all think:\n\nIs this just normal volatility around big tech capex cycles… or the first real crack in the AI narrative?",

      "content": "Invest in ETFs or 5.75% mortgage, or both?\n\nHi all,\n\nI’ve been browsing several investment and homeowner subs and I’m still unsure what makes the most sense financially. From what I’ve read, the consensus seems to be that the decision basically depends on mortgage interest rate. Seems like ~6% is sort of the grey area. Ours is 5.75%.\n\nA little over a year ago, I got a much better job so my income level is relatively high but I’ve only recently been able to contribute meaningfully (pretty much at all) to retirement and savings. Right now, I’m maxing my Roth IRA, HSA, and 401(k). We also just bought a house with a 5.75% mortgage. From what I understand, investing in broad ETFs like VTI and VXUS would historically yield more than 5.75% in the long run (like ~8%?), so I could potentially grow my wealth faster by investing. I feel a bit behind in savings for my age (31) and could afford to put money in now to try to catch up.\n\nBut, I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal, especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later. I’m wondering if it’s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns, or if there are other factors I should consider. Maybe it is best to do some of both? \n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Risk question for a younger investor\n\nHey guys, 22M here. \n\nI’m current sitting on $24k and recently cashed out on most of my individual stocks after this previous AI run up. I want to move this money into something a bit more safer than reddit stocks that I clearly got a bit lucky on, and want to start thinking a bit more long term. \n\nI previously thought of going 60% nasdaq and 40% all world, but at my age this seems a bit too boring. I want to be a bit more risky until age 25-30 before I start to get super safe with my investments. So I was thinking 100% Mag-7. Like I mentioned i’ve been pretty much gambling on reddit stocks for the past 3 years so can take a bit of risk, and this would be for long term holding. \n\nI would contribute around $600/month to this starting from this month and want to sit on most of my cash until a big correction, then would go all in with the $24k (into Mag-7, and save about 20% for some high risk AI/Nuclear/Quantum plays). \n\nWanted to get some more experienced thoughts on this to make sure i’m not missing anything important, besides from the fact that it would be a pretty bumpy ride. \n\nThanks \n\n",

      "content": "Seeking advice for my parents’ investment plan (mid-60s, new $500k inheritance)\n\nHello all!\n\nMy parents are ~65 and probably have another 7–10 years of earning ahead of them. They just inherited ~$500k and want to invest it gradually over the next 12–16 months. They don’t need the money right now and are comfortable with market volatility. Their goal is basically S&amp;P-500-level returns with a little diversification.\n\nThey recently opened a Schwab brokerage account and were told by a financial advisor that they “should” sign with him. We’re not sure that’s necessary since they’re leaning toward a simple, low-fee, ETF-based plan and dollar-cost averaging $5–10k per week.\n\nHere’s the rough allocation we’re considering:\n\nU.S. Large Cap (S&amp;P-ish): SCHX – 40%\n\nTotal U.S. Market: SCHB – 30%\n\nDeveloped International: SCHF – 10%\n\nEmerging Markets: SCHE – 5%\n\nU.S. Bonds: SCHZ – 10%\n\nTIPS: SCHP – 5%\n\nAll funds have low expense ratios and can be automated at Schwab.\n\nQuestions:\n\t1.\tDoes this allocation make sense for people in their mid-60s who don’t need the money immediately?\n\n\t2.\tAny pitfalls or nuances with this setup (ETF vs mutual fund, tax considerations, rebalancing, etc.)?\n\n\t3.\tWould a simpler one-fund option (like SWANX/SWYNX) be more appropriate?\n\n\t4.\tIs hiring a financial advisor here actually necessary, or is this straightforward enough to DIY?\n\nThanks in advance for any input.",

      "content": "What's the best financial institution to get a loan based on pledged stock assets?\n\nHere's my situation.  I've got about $900K in a non-IRA (Schwab) in an Irrevocable Trust (I'm the sole Beneficiary &amp; Trustee if that matters - the Trust itself is complex, but pretty much allows me to do what I want with it).  I want to get a line-of-credit loan of perhaps $150K, that I plan on paying off from an inherited Roth distribution (where I have about $700K) whenever I feel like it's time to ring the register on some position there.  Even though I would love to ring the register on some of those positions that are now (or soon will be) long-term unrealized gains, because I want to keep my ACA MAGI income at 150% of poverty to get a heavily subsidized Silver-94% plan, I can't extract the gains (indeed, some of these gains are 6X, so most of the proceeds would be gains), and so they are basically frozen until I get on Medicare (i.e., the combination of the lowered subsidies from an increase in income past 150% would be equivalent to a 25% implicit tax rate).  (I could retain the income in the Trust, but that would be at a 23.8% haircut - 20% long-term cap-gains + 3.8% ACA tax - oh, the irony, LOL)  If it matters, this $150K is to be used to pay for construction of a house (for my personal residence use) on a property that the Trust owns.\n\nI could just simply extract the cash in a regular margin from Schwab, but the interest rate is ridiculous (like 11%).  I think the margin is at IBKR is around 5.25%, but I wonder if I can have a Trust account there, as well as them having not-so-good service - although since I wouldn't be doing much, I guess it wouldn't be a big thing.  Any transfer would be to my Trust non-IRA (actually checking account associated with the Trust non-IRA) at Schwab, which is the account that I would be using to spend the money.\n\nI was talking to a friend of mine that has some assets at USB, and he got something like 6% on a loan (although this wasn't a Trust account) - and so I was thinking that some big bank might be in a better situation to give me a better loan.   I would tend to think that since this would be a loan with the Trust as the borrower, my own financial situation is irrelevant (for the record, my credit score is A+, but of course, my official income is very low, LOL).",

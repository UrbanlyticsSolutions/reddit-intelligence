      "content": "Buffett Says He Doesn’t Time the Market But Listen to This Quote\n\nPeople always say Buffett doesn’t time the market and that he just looks for value, buys good businesses, and ignores macro. That’s true in a sense, but when you listen to what he actually said at the latest Berkshire shareholder meeting, it sounds a lot like probability based market timing, just framed as value investing  \n  \nHe was [asked whether Berkshire’s huge cash pile was basically a derisking strategy](https://youtu.be/or0rgxnkOfE?si=Uo-b5Zvwvlv3cZ64&amp;t=1992). His answer was insightful:\n\n&gt;“We have $335 billion now in treasuries. We would rather have conditions where we would have like $50 billion… But that just isn’t the way the business works. We have made a lot of money by not wanting to be fully invested at all times. If you told me I had to invest $50 billion every year until we got down to $50 billion, that would be the dumbest thing in the world to invest in that manner. Things get extraordinarily attractive very occasionally and we’ll be glad we have the cash for it.”\n\nThen he goes further and clearly and explicitly speaks about when big opportunities show up:\n\n&gt;Very occasionally, but it’ll happen again, it could be next week, it could be five years off, but it won’t be 50 years off...There will be occasions in which we’ll be bombarded with offerings that we’ll be glad we have the cash for it. It’d be a lot more fun if it happened tomorrow, but it’s very unlikely to happen tomorrow. Very, very unlikely to happen tomorrow. **But it’s not unlikely to happen in five years, and the probabilities get higher as you go along.**\n\n&gt;It’s kind of like death. I mean, if you’re 10 years old, the chances that you’re going to die the next day are low. If you get to be 115 or something like that, it’s almost a cinch.\n\nTo me, he’s basically saying that the longer things stay expensive, the higher the odds that a big market disruption shows up. He’s not predicting exact dates, but he is making a clear judgment about where we are in the cycle and giving a rough timeline. Holding $300 billion in t-bills because you expect much better opportunities ahead could be called value discipline, but in practice it's just a form of timing based around valuations. I think people get confused because they equate “market timing” with shorting or making explicit calls like Burry. Buffett doesn’t short but he is deliberately building a massive cash position for a fall he thinks is reasonably likely within the next 5 or so years, and more likely as time passes.\n\nI'll post the full quote in the comments below, he explicitly recommends common people not to copy this strategy.",

      "title": "Understanding Michael Burry's Nvidia short: The real thesis explained",
      "content": "Understanding Michael Burry's Nvidia short: The real thesis explained\n\nThis week, Michael Burry revealed something unusual: Nvidia issued a formal memo rebutting his short thesis. When a $4 trillion company takes the rare step of responding directly to a single investor's position, it signals the argument has hit a nerve. Here's what Burry is actually saying, explained through Microsoft's example.\n\n**What Burry is NOT saying**  \nLet’s start by clearing up the biggest misconception. Burry is NOT saying NVDA is cooking its books or committing fraud. So if Burry isn’t targeting Nvidia’s accounting, what’s he actually saying?  \n  \nThe thesis is about Nvidia’s customers: Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. These “hyperscalers”, i.e., companies that own and operate the world’s largest data centers, are spending hundreds of billions of dollars buying Nvidia’s chips. And Burry argues they’re systematically misstating the economic reality of their GPU purchases.\n\n**The core thesis: Economic vs physical lifespan**  \nHere's the problem: When data centers buy NVDA chips, they depreciate them over 5-6 years. Microsoft extended from 4 to 6 years, and Meta to 5.5 years. But Burry argues that chip technology is advancing so fast that the real economic life of chips is just 2-3 years.\n\nSo what?\n\n**The accounting impact**\n\nLet’s understand the impact by using Microsoft as an example. Microsoft purchased 485k NVDA chips in 2024 and spent roughly $17 billion in GPU purchases in 2024 alone. So what happens if we depreciate them over 6 years instead of 3?  \n  \n\\- $17B in GPUs depreciated over 6 years = $2.8 B/year expense  \n\\- If economic life is really 3 years = $5.7B/year expense  \n  \nThe difference: $2.9B/year in overstated earnings\n\nMicrosoft’s FY2024 net income was $88.1B. A $2.9B overstatement represents 3.3% of reported profits. That might not sound like much, but this is just from one year of GPU purchases. If similar spending occurred in 2022, 2023, and 2025, the cumulative overstatement could be $10–12B annually, or roughly 11–14% of reported earnings.  \n\n\n**What this means for the stock price**\n\nCurrently, Microsoft trades at approximately $492 per share with a P/E ratio of 34 and earnings per share of $14.11. If earnings were adjusted down by 11–14% to reflect realistic GPU depreciation, the adjusted EPS would fall to $12.13-$12.56. Assuming the P/E ratio remains at 34, the stock price would drop to $412–427 ,  a decline of $65–80 per share, or roughly 13–16%. However, if investors also lose confidence in AI infrastructure returns, the P/E multiple could compress further, potentially amplifying losses beyond the accounting adjustment alone.\n\n**The valuation impact**\n\nCurrently, Stockoscope's DCF model values MSFT at $384.93 per share, implying the stock is already 22% overvalued. This calculation assumes capital expenditure of 15.7% of revenue.  \n  \nHowever, if Burry is right and GPUs need to be replaced every three years, the capex will increase to &gt;20% of revenue. This will reduce free cash flow and lower the total enterprise value. We have crunched the numbers, and this higher capex will reduce enterprise value by $547 billion and the per-share intrinsic value by $73.44 in our DCF model.   \n  \nSo, the Burry-adjusted fair value becomes **$311.49 per share**. This represents a 19% reduction from our baseline fair value and suggests Microsoft is overvalued by 37% at the current price of $491.92.\n\nNote: This isn't just an MSFT problem. Amazon, Google, and Meta are all facing the same dynamics. The impact across the hyperscaler industry could be significant. We just focused on Microsoft because it's easier to understand one concrete example than vague industry trends.\n\n**The Nvidia connection: How this destroys demand**\n\nNow we come full circle to why Burry is short Nvidia, not Microsoft. Well, if investors recognize that GPUs will become obsolete in 3 years rather than 6, the financial pressure intensifies. Boards will demand better returns and more disciplined spending. As capital allocation tightens and upgrade cycles extend, demand for Nvidia chips could collapse, potentially destabilizing the entire AI infrastructure market.  \n\nAlso, Microsoft has a diversified business. Even if Azure AI disappoints, it still has Office, Windows, LinkedIn, and gaming. The stock might be overvalued, but the company isn’t going away.\n\nOn the other hand, Nvidia is a pure play on AI infrastructure demand. If hyperscalers slow purchasing even modestly, Nvidia’s revenue collapses. The company is priced for perfection, assuming indefinite exponential growth.\n\nThat’s the trap Burry sees: Nvidia’s revenue depends on customers making economically irrational decisions. Once the music stops, the stock has nowhere to hide.\n\n**The $500 Billion question**\n\nMichael Burry isn’t betting against AI. He’s not claiming Nvidia makes bad products. He’s not even saying Microsoft is a bad company.\n\nHe’s asking a simpler, more fundamental question: *Can Microsoft and its peers sustain billions in capital expenditures indefinitely, when the infrastructure they’re building may need to be replaced every 3 years instead of 6?*\n\nThe market is betting “yes” -  that AI will generate returns justifying this spending.\n\nBurry is betting “no” -  that the accounting assumptions don’t match reality, that CFOs will eventually rein in spending when the math doesn’t work, and that Nvidia’s demand will cliff when that happens.\n\nTime will tell who’s right, but where do you see yourself? Are you leaning towards yes or no?",

Whether it’s a company in a fast-growing sector, something heavily undervalued, or a business that’s on the edge of a major breakthrough what makes you believe it can go the distance?\n\nDrop your top two plays and the reasoning behind them. Curious to see what everyone’s highest conviction picks are. ",

Not by lying, but by moving normal revenue into the AI bucket and pushing a lot of the costs somewhere else. The part that stood out to me is how much of the early AI demand is coming from internal credits and vendor incentives. That never lasts forever and it usually makes the early margins look stronger than they really are. It reminded me a lot of the early cloud stories where companies talked up growth, but the real costs showed up a few quarters later. I’m trying to figure out how much of the current AI excitement is real demand and how much is just accounting.",

EDIT: you are not comfortable adding more to stocks or RE as they represent a vast majority of the portfolio already.\n\nWith an IRR of 3.5% over 30 years that you can access through tax-free loans (loan interest is covered by cash value interests), wouldn't WLI yield decent returns for retirement? Consider that at a tax rate of 40%, a taxable brokerage account would need 5.8% in IRR for the same after-tax money. EDIT: HYSA's yield about 3.5% pre-tax.\n\n\nEDIT: please don't simply reply \"yes\" or \"no\" without justification, this thread is not meant to be a vote",

      "content": "Bank of America reaffirms bullish stance on Nvidia as growth projections strengthen\n\nNvidia’s outlook has been getting a steady boost as analysts highlight several tailwinds for the company. Beyond the optimism around AI server demand, some brokerages point out that Nvidia could see incremental revenue from adjusted China-compliant chips if U.S. export rules settle into a predictable pattern. There’s also renewed interest in how Nvidia’s partnerships especially with Intel for foundry support might help the company diversify its supply chain. While Nvidia still relies heavily on TSMC, having additional manufacturing pathways is seen as a long-term advantage, particularly with global semiconductor capacity constraints. At the same time, institutions note that demand for data-center GPUs remains structurally strong. Cloud providers and large enterprises continue to scale AI training capacity, and Nvidia’s ecosystem advantage (CUDA, software stack, and developer tools) remains a major barrier for competitors.\nStill, some analysts caution that Nvidia’s valuation leaves little room for error. Any slowdown in hyperscaler spending, delays in China revenue, or competitive pressure from Google TPUs or AMD MI chips could introduce volatility. Overall, the sentiment leans positive, but with the usual caveats around competition and macro risks.",

The right ones tend to be slower and more fundamental:\n\n   1. Is intrinsic value changing, or is only the price changing?\n\n   2. Has the company’s earning power deteriorated in a way that is measurable?\n\n   3. Does the updated price improve the long-term expected return?\n\n\n\nA small example of how this shows up in real valuations, recently I evaluated Planet Labs (PL). \n\nTwo things stood out:\n\nThe market was reacting to quarterly noise. The normalized free cash flow had shifted positive. Intrinsic value barely moved. The “volatility discount” created a mispricing. Because price dropped sharply over short-term sentiment.\n\nThis made me rethink something:\n\n**Value investing isn’t about predicting it’s about resisting reaction.** That raises a broader question I’d love to hear this subreddit’s thoughts on:\n\n1. How do you personally separate “price movement that feels urgent” from “fundamental change that actually matters”?\n\n2. Do you use any structured process to evaluate whether a price drop is meaningful (e.g., checklists, fundamental triggers, long-term normalized metrics)?\n\n3. How do you prevent short-term volatility from influencing your valuation work or estimate of intrinsic value?\n\n4. What helps you remain objective when the market narrative becomes highly emotional?\n\n\n\nNot asking for stock tips or recommendations, more interested in how other value-focused investors maintain discipline in a market that constantly pushes the opposite behavior.\n\nLooking forward to hearing different approaches the community uses to stay anchored to fundamentals.",

Mohnish in specific empathized that this is especially true if it's in a sector with many competitors and doesn't innovate.\n\nI use PayPal often for business and individual purposes, but lately I've been shifting to alternatives with similar/cheaper services like WISE.\n\nAll these other comparable fintech players have/are building out new technology, whereas PYPL has remained relatively focused on what they've done from the start.\n\nFundamentally the company appears to be doing okay for a stalwart, but I'm heavily considering selling my shares I bought at $65 a while back and reinvesting into a more innovative/growth oriented conpany.\n\nWhy do you hold PYPL, or have you sold/are considering buying.\n\nI know people are going to keep saying \"patience\", but it seems foolish to keep holding, especially after hearing investors such as Pabrai and Lu discuss the exact situation PYPL is in. Anyone who bought when the company first bottomed out has missed out on like 50% of returns during these yearsvof bull markets.\n\n",

The potential deal would involve production of approximately 15-20 million units annually for MacBook Air and iPad Pro devices, representing a cautious diversification of Apple's supply chain away from sole reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.\n\nThe rally came despite ongoing legal tensions with TSMC, including reports of a raid on an Intel executive's home in Taiwan related to allegations of stolen technology. Investors appeared to look past the litigation drama, focusing instead on the prospects of securing Apple as a foundry customer, which analysts described as having improved significantly.\n\nIntel led chip stocks higher on Friday, helping drive the broader S&amp;P 500 to gains and turning the index positive for November. The stock outperformed competitors on heavy trading volume, with options activity notably elevated. The potential Apple partnership, while modest in scale compared to TSMC's high-end chip production for Apple, would mark a significant validation of Intel's foundry ambitions and its advanced 18A manufacturing process.",

      "content": "Why ADBE Might Actually Thrive In The AI Era Thanks To Its IP Approach\n\nThere is a lot of talk about generative AI disrupting creative work, such as video and photo generation. But I believe Adobe could actually benefit from this shift because of the way it handles data and intellectual property.\n\nFirefly, Adobe’s generative AI, is trained only on content Adobe owns or that is in the public domain. Unlike some AI models that use content scraped without permission, Adobe relies on licensed assets like Adobe Stock. This gives them a clear legal advantage.\n\nAdobe also clarified in its terms of use that it will not use customer content to train AI models. This means anything users create or upload stays private and is not fed back into AI training. This level of legal certainty could be very appealing to professionals and businesses worried about possible IP and copyright infringement in their work.\n\nAs lawsuits over unlicensed data inevitably increase when regulatory finally catches up with the technology, Adobe’s reputation for legal compliance and transparency becomes an asset. They are also implementing content provenance and metadata tracking, which shows authorship and AI involvement. This kind of accountability could be a major differentiator.\n\nIt would be fair to mention that Google and Meta has probably the most valuable video (Youtube) and photo (Instagram) data sets in the world. And their fine print in their Terms of Service gives them the rights to use that content, but that could definitely be pressured in the future. But Adobe also has its entire Adobe stock data sets its AI trains on which gives uses confidence that they should not have to worry about copyright infringement, etc. \n\nWhile some smaller AI companies may be more exposed to future legal and copyright risks, Adobe’s approach could allow it not just to survive but to thrive.",

But over time investors started selling the stock, causing its price to go down, out of fear of the risk its RPOs and debt presented. I wonder if a similar pattern might happen in Q2.\n\nThis seems similar to bonds or tbill ETFs where they start going up until a maturity date (due to credit risk) at which point it crashes and the cycle restarts.

      "content": "Am I crazy for wanting to buy put leaps on SLV?\n\nI’m sure you have seen the buzz around silver. I saw some fancy charts by the memesters showing it at new all time highs and now just being the best time to get in before its too late. \n\nThe only argument for a continuation of the rally I can find is really just based around it being some kind of hedge in case things go caputs. But when things go caputs, silver looks to also go caputs. \n\nIt seems to take a few years to really reclaim earlier prices like when it crashed in 2011, it lost 50% in 2 years around April/May 2013. Then the bottom finally came 4.75 years later around Dec of 15 for a 72% decline from the ATH. A move like that from the ATH on SLV of 51.27 would mean a 13.86 price tag by around the end of 2030. A 50% move to 25.60 by Jan 2028. \n\nA $40 put can be bought for about 4$ Jan 2028 which would theoretically be worth about $14 or 3.5x. \n\nGiven Silvers inability to hold and consolidate ATH’s in the past, why isn’t it a good idea to just buy 2028 puts each month like its a savings account and look forward to cashing it out in a few years once the memesters are out of fire power?

      "content": "Advice on investing strategy, multiple ETFs to add diversification for riskier stock portfolio?\n\nHey folks, \n\nRelatively new investor here, just started earlier this year with an inheritance fund, looking for advice on this strategy and balancing risk with security. I have a pretty high risk tolerance for \\~50% of my port in stocks for short to medium term gains and \\~50% in long term 20+ year ETFs as retirement fund. \n\nProfile: 33M, single no kids, western Europe, low mortgage, low expenses, have a 3 month safety net, monthly savings and aiming to invest 300 - 500 per month with the following portfolio goal (note: my current portfolio is a mess with many individual stocks I bought a small amount of when starting out as experimentation, so I plan to sell off all the noise and increase my safety net in long term ETFs. My current portfolio (\\~30k) looks something like this: \n\nETFs:  \n\\- 30% Amundi Prime All-World (WEBN)  \n\\- 10% Amundi STOXX Europe 600 Acc (LYP6)  \n\\- 5% WisdomTree Europe Defence (EUDF) \n\nStocks:  \n\\- 30% - across 10 medium term high conviction Tech/AI: GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, META, AMD, AVGO, NBIS, SOFI, ASML  \n\\- 20% - across 20 or so short-medium term low conviction Tech &amp; Other stocks (I won´t list them but everything from AMZ, VRT, IREN, TSMC, MU, BABA, RKLB, ASTS and some utilities, raw materials etc, generally speculative plays.    \n\\- 5% - I consider noise, learning experiences, minor investments of 5 - 50 eur which I´ll gradually close.   \n\n\nBefore you all jump down my throat, I know I am overstretched and overcomplicated. Given my risk profile, I am happy to keep 30 - 40% of portfolio within the growth/tech sector as that´s my main area of interest and I don´t believe my Top 10 above are going anywhere in the next 5 years regardless of AI bubble. I am also happy to keep 10% in relatively speculative plays but will try to reduce that list to 10 companies or so. For this group I plan to trim regularly to fund the ETFs on top of regular monthly investments. \n\nEventually, as I get older and want more security, I will aim for 60-70% ETFs, maybe some other assets like gold/real estate/bonds etc, so my main question now is on the ETFs above and your thoughts on adding another or if this would be redundant. I´m considering adding something like FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield Acc (VHYG) or an Emerging Markets/ex-US fund. I´m thinking these may offer broader exposure in the case of downturns, sector rotations, crashes. I´m attracted to high dividend ETF as they may be more stable, defensive, consumer/utility companies but I don´t care for the payout of dividends just the exposure to broader sectors and regions. I´m naturally avoiding anything that´s high-tech or high-US given the above allocation. \n\nCan you give me your thoughts on this? Does an All world Dividend Accumulating ETF make sense or am I just overcomplicating it more? Should I stick to WEBN, LYP6 or any better alternatives?   \nI expect many of you will say to invest in a Tech sector ETF but I quite enjoy the picking and following and researching of the companies, and want to allocate accordingly e.g. I do not want to invest in PLTR, APPL, TSLA for reasons. \n\nLastly, I use T212 so many ETF tickers I see suggested in other threads here just aren´t available on that like VTO, QQQ and others. \n\nThanks!

      "content": "Variable SWR before and after SS?\n\nEveryone understands the 4% savings withdrawal rate rule For a 30-year successful retirement and statistically not running out of money. \n\nBut I wonder, has anyone modeled a variable withdrawal rate? For example, a 5% withdrawal rate from age 65 to 70 and then after social security kicks in at age 70, lowering that to 3% for 10 years or so. Then as your nest egg compounds and grows and your social security increases at about 2.5% COLA compounded, reducing your SWR to perhaps 2% per year from age 80 onward. \n\nThe appeal of this is withdrawing more early in your retirement when you have energy to travel and spend money versus withdrawing smaller amounts at higher ages when you have less interest in spending money and traveling",

MARKET SENTIMENT: **BEARISH WITH RETAIL ANXIETY**\n\nThe sentiment across data sources reveals a conflicted but predominantly bearish picture:\n- **Reddit sentiment** shows extreme anxiety with themes of economic instability, political uncertainty, and retail trading mistakes (OTM puts held over weekend)\n- **Market data** shows weakness in key tech (NVDA -2.08%) and semiconductor sectors (SOXS -5.37%)\n- **Macro backdrop** remains challenging with elevated VIX (17.21), 10Y yield at 4.0%, and unemployment at 4.4%\n- **Contradictory signals**: Strong Black Friday sales data conflicts with consumer sentiment collapse warnings\n\n### 2. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL SOURCES\n\n**Economic Uncertainty & Political Risk**\n- Trump administration economic data deletions and credibility concerns\n- \"Instability and fear\" narratives dominating retail discussions\n- CIO warnings about collapsed consumer sentiment\n\n**AI & Technology Focus**\n- Multiple AI stock discussions (Buffett's AI holdings, Burry's Nvidia short thesis)\n- AI startup formation and boom continuation debates\n- NVDA volatility and semiconductor sector movements\n\n**Retail & Consumer Behavior Dichotomy**\n- Record Black Friday online sales ($11.8B) vs. holiday spending cuts\n- Meme stock nostalgia (GME, Roaring Kitty references)\n- Retail trading mistakes and emotional market reactions\n\n**Dividend & Defensive Positioning**\n- High-yielding dividend stock recommendations\n- Nuclear sector interest as defensive play\n- Value vs. growth debates\n\n### 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n\n**Immediate Catalysts:**\n- Early market closure creating options risk (retail OTM puts exposure)\n- Black Friday sales data exceeding expectations\n- ECB rate hold expectations with Euro-zone inflation near 2%\n\n**Technical Signals:**\n- NVDA breaking below key levels with elevated volatility\n- SOXS (semiconductor bear ETF) showing significant movement\n- Micro-cap volatility (AMZE +21%, BEAT +24%) indicating speculative flows\n\n**Macro Signals:**\n- Elevated risk premium (4.33%) suggesting continued equity risk\n- Fed funds rate at 3.88% maintaining restrictive policy\n- Gold (GLD 388.25) holding as safe haven\n\n### 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n**Primary Risks:**\n- Political instability affecting economic data credibility\n- Retail sentiment collapse despite strong consumption data\n- Semiconductor sector weakness spreading to broader tech\n- Options market mispositioning creating Monday volatility\n\n**Opportunities:**\n- Defensive sectors benefiting from flight to quality\n- AI infrastructure plays despite near-term volatility\n- Dividend stocks in high-yield environment\n- Contrarian positioning against extreme retail pessimism\n\n### 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n\n**NVDA**: Monitor $170 support level - break below could trigger broader tech selloff. Burry's short thesis gaining attention creates headline risk.\n\n**SOXS**: Semiconductor bear ETF movement suggests sector rotation - consider hedges in tech portfolios.\n\n**XLF**: Financials may benefit from higher rates environment and defensive positioning.\n\n**Consumer Discretionary vs Staples**: Black Friday strength vs sentiment collapse creates divergence - watch December sales data for confirmation.\n\n**GLD**: Gold holding as political/economic uncertainty hedge - maintain allocation for portfolio protection.\n\n**Dividend Stocks**: Focus on high-yielding, stable companies as retail flows seek income in volatile market.\n\n**Monday Opening**: Expect elevated volatility due to weekend options positioning and political developments.\n\n**SECTOR: Technology** - Reduce exposure to speculative AI names, focus on established cash-flow positive tech with dividend components.\n\n**SECTOR: Utilities/Staples** - Defensive rotation likely to continue given sentiment indicators and political uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n*Analysis Time: 2025-11-29 13:15:19 | Next Update Recommended: EOD Monday to assess weekend sentiment and options impact*",

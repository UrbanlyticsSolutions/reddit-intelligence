      "content": "Netflix agrees to buy Warner Bros. in a $72-billion deal that will transform Hollywood\n\nNetflix has prevailed in its bid to buy much of Warner Bros. Discovery, agreeing to pay $72 billion for the Burbank-based Warner Bros. film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.\n\nThe two companies announced the blockbuster deal early Friday morning. The deal would give Netflix such beloved characters as Batman, Harry Potter and Fred Flintstone.\n\n“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a statement. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like ‘Casablanca’ and ‘Citizen Kane’ to modern favorites like ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Friends’ — with our culture-defining titles like ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ and ‘Squid Game,’ we’ll be able to do that even better.”\n\nNetflix’s cash and stock transaction is valued at about $27.75 per Warner Bros. Discovery shares. Netflix also agreed to take on more than $10 billion in Warner Bros. debt, pushing the deal’s value to $82.7 billion.\n\nThe breakthrough came late Thursday, soon after a deadline for deal sweeteners. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast had submitted bids earlier in the week as jockeying intensified for Hollywood’s biggest prize.\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-12-05/netflix-prevails-in-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-opponents",

There is simply no way for shorts to close (i.e., satisfying a lot of buying demand) without affecting price (i.e., up).  *The only other possible explanation is the reported short interest was hidden off-books and thus, not reported anymore*.\n\n&gt;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. \\[Sherlock Holmes (Arthur Conan Doyle)\\]\n\n**PCO dropped the price on GME;** ***then*** **Short Interest was hidden.**  ***300%+ SI still.***\n\n# Splividend (July 2022 4:1 Stock Split in the form of a Dividend)\n\nGameStop issued a 4:1 Stock Split in the form of a Dividend (\"Splividend\") \\[[SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vtvbl8/gme_41_stock_split_in_the_form_of_a_dividend/)\\]\n\n&gt;On July 6, 2022, GameStop Corp. (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors had approved and declared a **four-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend**. Each Company stockholder of record at the close of business on July 18, 2022 will receive three additional shares of the Company’s Class A common stock for each then-held share of Class A common stock, to be distributed after the close of trading on July 21, 2022.\n\nThe difference between a stock split and one in the form of a dividend is that the Company (GameStop) provides the new shares in the form of a dividend to shareholders whereas a stock split would simply multiply everyone's positions.\n\nThis distinction is rather important because GameStop performed a stock split in the form of a dividend so shorts must provide new shares to whoever they sold short to.  *But they didn't...*\n\nInstead, Punny and I found that the DTCC processed the Splividend as a **stock split** [**sans**](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sans) **dividend** because \"Due Bill **Fail Tracking does not monitor stock splits**\". \\[[SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wfff5l/why_the_dtcc_processed_it_as_a_stock_split_how/), [SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wfg2vj/i_think_i_found_why_did_the_dtcc_performed_a/)\\]  The short positions were simply multiplied.\n\n[DTCC Processed As Stock Split to avoid Due Bill Fail Tracking](https://preview.redd.it/fwk52ijwze5g1.png?width=3394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f47763dbdebbf2a1261a461b6a1ea23cf9d2074b)\n\nMultiply the 300%+ SI by 4 because of the 4:1 splividend and that's **1200%+ SI**. ***Short Interest of approximately 12 GME Outstandings.***  \\[2 (🤦‍♂️ See EDIT below)\\]\n\nGME is *still* below the July 2022 price level which means those shorts have not closed.  Hidden, certainly.  Closed? Impossible. \\[3\\]\n\n\\[1\\] FINRA is reporting Short Interest % (of Outstanding) not Short Interest % of Float.  Outstanding Shares is a fixed number whereas Float can change (umm... *floats*).\n\n\\[2\\] As a result of the splividend, shorts were *supposed* to deliver 3 shares for every 1 short which means 300% x 3 = 900% were due for delivery by shorts.  900% new short interest for delivery in addition to the existing 300% short interest is 1200%.  However, the DTCC \"Due Bill Fail Tracking does not monitor stock splits\" so the new 900% SI is *not tracked*.\n\n\\[3\\] This calculation does not include any new shorts opened to keep the price suppressed as apes love to buy, hodl, and DRS.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nSorry folks, apparently I'm sort of high.  🤣 As has been explained by some below, I should not just multiply percentages (something I forgot in my enthusiasm).\n\n\\~111M (Previous Outstanding) x 4:1 = 447M Outstanding where GameStop provided the extra \\~336M shares.\n\n300%+ SI (\\~336M) shorts previously and then after the splividend they are short 4x that number: 1,344M.  (Note: It would be accurate to say that the shorts are now at 12x the 2021 GME Outstandings so we can shoehorn the title into truth 🤣.)\n\nShort % should stay the same (i.e., 1,344M/447M is still 3x or 300%) as the number of shares short were multiplied 4x along with the denominator (outstanding shares).\n\n**HOWEVER**, it's important to note that the new shorts from the splividend **were not tracked** by the DTCC.  *Where did those 1,008M (=3 x 336M) newly minted shorts go?*\n\nThe June/July Short Interest % didn't change that much (19.88% to 22.39%) even though a billion new shorts were not monitored by Due Bill Fail Tracking.\n\n😵‍💫 Those new shorts were **not tracked**.\n\nShort positions are either reported and show up in the reported Short Interest %; *or not and don't.*  As those 1,008M new GME shorts were not tracked by the DTCC, they stayed with their parent shorts **outside** of reported Short Interest %.  Being untracked, odds are pretty good they were \"recycled\" into longs (i.e., sold to someone whose broker rehypothecated the shares and lent out as a long); lather, rinse, repeat 3-4 times per the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10172.pdf) and [Fed Note](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.html).  (A 4x multiplier along a different path.)\n\nApologies for the confusion &amp; hype.",

That puts the total enterprise value of the transaction at approximately $82.7 billion.\n\nThe deal is for WBD’s film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. Warner Bros. Discovery will still spin out its TV networks, which includes TNT and CNN, as previously planned.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to close after that separation takes place, now expected in the third quarter of 2026.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/neflix-warner-bros-discovery-deal.html",

      "content": "‘China’s Nvidia’ Moore Threads surges over 400% on trading debut after $1.1 billion listing\n\nMoore Threads had a massive first day in Shanghai, jumping more than 400% after its $1.1 billion IPO. It’s one of the biggest debuts for a Chinese chip company this year and comes at a time when Beijing is pushing hard to build a domestic GPU ecosystem. The timing matters. With U.S. sanctions limiting China’s access to advanced manufacturing, companies like Moore Threads, Huawei, and Cambricon are all stepping in to fill the gap. China clearly wants local alternatives that can support AI, gaming, and data-center workloads without depending on U.S. suppliers. Moore Threads still has a long way to go in matching the performance of global leaders, but the market’s reaction shows how much enthusiasm there is behind China’s semiconductor push. The broader chip sector in China has been accelerating, with new entrants and established players all competing for the same growing demand. Curious what everyone thinks is this early hype or a sign that China’s GPU ecosystem is finally gaining real momentum?\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/china-nvidia-moore-threads-trading-debut-1-billion-listing-ipo-shanghai-gpu-enflame-biren.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/china-nvidia-moore-threads-trading-debut-1-billion-listing-ipo-shanghai-gpu-enflame-biren.html)",

      "content": "Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting has just concluded, leaving the market with several intriguing signals.\n\nToday, Microsoft shareholders formally approved all company proposals, including board elections and the 2026 stock plan.\n\nBut more notably shareholders rejected all six shareholder proposals, including one demanding Microsoft submit a “human rights due diligence report.”\n\nThis raises several questions:\n\nAmid AI's sweeping expansion, Microsoft increasingly resembles a “state-owned enterprise among tech giants.” Yet shareholders have clearly granted the company greater autonomy this time.\n\nFrom a purely market perspective, this outcome is almost entirely positive for the stock price, as the company avoids being shackled by additional regulatory reporting requirements.\n\nYet from a long-term ESG and social responsibility perspective, won't this become a latent concern for Microsoft? Especially as tensions escalate around sensitive areas like OpenAI, AI regulation, and data ethics.\n\nMy personal take: This vote feels more like the market collectively saying, “Keep driving performance we don't want distractions.”\n\nBut as AI operations expand, whether such proposals resurface remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs this a rational market choice, or is it merely deferring potential long-term risks?\n\nI'm particularly curious to hear others' perspectives on Microsoft's positioning under AI regulatory pressure over the next 1–3 years.",

      "title": "Clean energy isn’t failing. It’s threatening the people who built fortunes on scarcity.",
      "content": "Clean energy isn’t failing. It’s threatening the people who built fortunes on scarcity.\n\nMost people are reading the clean energy sector completely wrong.  \n  \nThey look at red charts, crushed valuations, and ugly sentiment and think:  \n\"See, it was all hype. The tech doesn’t work. The economics don’t add up.\"  \n  \nNo. The tech works. The physics work. The economics work.  \nWhat doesn’t work anymore is the old power structure built on scarcity.\n\n# 1. Oil survives on scarcity. Clean energy survives on abundance.\n\nOil is valuable because it is limited.  \n  \nYou can control supply.  \nYou can restrict access.  \nYou can manipulate flows and influence pricing.  \n  \nThat model has fed entire dynasties, countries, and corporate empires for decades.  \n  \nClean energy is the opposite.  \n  \nYou cannot corner the sun.  \nYou cannot own the wind.  \nYou cannot put a fence around photons.  \n  \nAs you scale solar, wind, storage, and smarter grids, you move closer to something energy markets are not built to handle: practical abundance. When a resource moves toward abundance, long term prices tend to trend down and control shifts away from those who used scarcity as leverage.  \n  \nThat does not threaten the technology.  \nIt threatens the business model that ruled the last century.\n\n# 2. Old money versus new players\n\nThis is not a morality play. It is a capital structure problem.  \n  \nOil money has had decades to dig into governments, regulators, media, and financial systems.  \nNew clean energy companies are still building basic profitability and scale. They do not have the same lobbying power or political weight.  \n  \nSo when you see pressure on clean energy stocks, it is not just \"the market is disappointed.\" It is also the inertia of old capital defending its territory.  \n  \nOld money is not going to roll over because the physics improved.\n\n# 3. Why clean energy stocks all look the same on the chart\n\nPeople say:  \n\"If this sector is the future, why do all these charts look like trash?\"  \n  \nBecause the market is not just pricing tech. It is pricing resistance.  \n  \nThe closer we move toward widespread clean energy adoption, the more direct the threat to those who rely on controlled scarcity. That resistance does not target one company. It hits the entire sector.  \n  \nSo the charts move together.  \n  \nMass rerates up when optimism spikes.  \nThen mass punishment when pressure comes back in.  \nRinse, repeat.  \n  \nYou are not just watching fundamentals. You are watching a power struggle reflected in price action.\n\n# 4. The transition is inevitable, but not painless\n\nClean energy wins on the long timeline for one reason: it is better aligned with physics and long term economics.  \n  \nOnce the upfront buildout is done, a lot of the \"fuel\" is free.  \nSunlight does not send an invoice. Wind does not negotiate shipping rates.  \n  \nBut the speed of the transition is not decided only by engineers. It is decided by capital and policy.  \n  \nThat is why you can see:\n\n* The technology already working at scale in many regions\n* The costs already competitive or better\n* Yet the sector still trading like it is some failed experiment\n\nThere is a fight over how fast the old model gets dismantled.\n\n# 5. What this means for investors\n\nIf you look at clean energy names and only see “downtrend,” you are missing the bigger picture.  \n  \nYes, the sector is volatile.  \nYes, many companies will fail.  \nYes, a lot of garbage got funded along the way.  \n  \nBut at the structural level, you are dealing with a simple reality:\n\n* The old world is built on monetizing scarcity.\n* The new world is built on scaling abundance.\n\nThe economic winner is obvious over decades. The path there will not be smooth, especially when trillions in old capital are on the line.\n\nThis is not financial advice.  \nIt is a reminder that red charts do not automatically mean \"dead tech.\"  \n  \nSometimes they mean the future is colliding with people who have every reason to delay it.",

      "content": "Core inflation rate watched by Fed hit 2.8%, delayed September data shows, lower than expected\n\nhe latest core PCE numbers showed a 0.2% increase month-over-month and a 2.8% annual rate, keeping inflation on the gradual downward trend the Fed has been hoping for. Since PCE is the Fed’s preferred gauge, this print will likely factor into next week’s meeting, where markets already expect another rate cut. Personal income rose 0.4% for the month, while spending increased 0.3%, a bit softer than forecast but still pointing to steady consumer activity. Overall, nothing shocking in the data just more signs that inflation is cooling, but not fast enough to fully remove uncertainty around policy.\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/pce-inflation-report-september-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/pce-inflation-report-september-2025.html)",

      "content": "Barron's Stock Picks : Weyerhaeuser Stock Trades for Less Than the Value of Its Lumber. It’s Time to Buy.\n\nBarron's latest stock pick: Weyerhaeuser lumber. Another interesting choice. \n\n  \n\"The 125-year-old company is the largest private owner of timberland in North America, with over 10 million acres, including valuable tracts in the Pacific Northwest, where it holds over two million acres. It also operates 33 manufacturing plants across the continent, where it produces wood products.\n\nLumber prices fell 20% this year, to $550 per 1,000 board feet. The shares, now around $21.50, have lost half their value since peaking in 2022, and trade where they did in the late 1990s.\"\n\n\"Shares of the Seattle-based company, which yield nearly 4%, now trade for less than the value of the timber assets Weyerhaeuser accumulated over a century, a fact that offers considerable downside protection to an already battered stock. And while Wall Street is downbeat on the housing market[d](https://www.barrons.com/articles/home-builder-stocks-0f5a401c?mod=article_inline) in 2026, that view could be too pessimistic. The stock offers massive upside if lumber and wood-products markets improve.\"\n\n  \nIt may not look that way at first glance. Weyerhaeuser, structured as a real estate investment trust, is now operating at just above break-even based on generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, earnings. The company is expected to earn 17 cents a share in 2025 and 26 cents in 2026. That puts its price/earnings ratio near 100.\n\nBut high valuations in economically cyclical stocks often signal a buying opportunity because they’re based on depressed earnings, which should recover. And Weyerhaeuser is capable of earning much more. It generated over $3 a share in earnings in 2021 and 2022, when lumber prices topped $1,000 per 1,000 board feet.\"\n\nThe stock looks far cheaper based on its net asset value. Weyerhaeuser is valued at about $2,000 per acre of its timberland based on its enterprise value of $21 billion, which combines a $16 billion equity market cap with $5 billion of net debt. That valuation is below the $2,800-an-acre price of the average timberland transaction in 2024 and 2025. The company’s forests in Oregon and Washington state are particularly valuable because they produce desirable wood from Douglas fir trees.\"\n\nTheir directors have also been buying recently. It's an interesting choice, and the recent Barrons picks have mostly increased or stayed flat, so if you have a long term view it could pay off. Until then the dividend is 4%.",

      "content": "My 6 High-Conviction Plays for 2026: From Deep Value to GARP Compounders (PLMR, SKWD, MOH, LULU, FOUR, NU)\n\nI have seen some users complaining and a lot of posts about the same companies, so I wanted to share my top 6 value picks for 2026, hopefully at least a couple of names are different. Disclosure - I currently own all. I’m splitting this into two buckets: **Deep Value** (distressed multiples) and **GARP** (Growth at a Reasonable Price)\n\nI’m looking for compounders that the market is mispricing relative to their future cash flows. \n\n# The \"GARP\" Compounders (Growth at a Reasonable Price)\n\nThese stocks look expensive if you only stare at the trailing P/E, but the cash flows tell a different story. \n\n# 1. Palomar Holdings ($PLMR)\n\n* This is a specialty insurer dominating niches like earthquake and wind insurance. They are growing like a SaaS company but valued like a bank.\n* **Value Metrics:**\n   * **P/E (Trailing):** \\~18.7x\n   * **PEG Ratio:** **\\~1.2**. Paying &lt;20x earnings for 70% net income growth \n   * **Growth:** Q3 Net Income exploded **+70% YoY** to $55.2M.\n   * **Balance Sheet:** Cash &amp; Invested Assets of **$1.3 Billion**.\n* **Thesis:** The \"E&amp;S\" (Excess &amp; Surplus) market is typically quite challenging to succeed in, and big insurers are fleeing. Palomar is picking up the slack with massive pricing power. They are proving their model works. As they continue to compound earnings at this rate, the market will be forced to re-rate the stock higher. I expect multiple expansion in 2026. This one is a low risk, high reward pick. \n\n# 2. Skyward Specialty Insurance ($SKWD)\n\n* Another insurance play that is different from PLMR. They focus on niches standard carriers avoid and print cash\n* **Value Metrics:**\n   * **P/E:** \\~13x \n   * **PEG Ratio:** \\~**0.6** based on 50%+ premium growth\n   * **FCF Yield:** Hovering around **19%**, which is very high.\n   * **Growth:** Gross Written Premiums surged **52% YoY** in Q3 2025.\n   * **Debt:** Super clean. Debt-to-Capital ratio is under **11%**.\n* **Thesis:** The market is pricing this for zero growth, yet they just delivered their best combined ratio ever (89.2%). It's a cash machine trading at a discount. I expect the headwinds from their latest acquisition of Apollo Group Holdings to clear. It gives Skyward access to Lloyd's Syndicates, allowing them to underwrite complex global risks they couldn't touch before. Apollo brings a specific focus on \"New Economy\" industries (Sharing Economy, Autonomous Vehicles, Robotics). Skyward is now one of the few insurers with the data and expertise to underwrite the future of tech. \n\n# 3. Nu Holdings ($NU)\n\n* Latin American digital banking monopoly. People see the 30x P/E and run, but they are missing the unit economics. This is a cash-printing machine disguised as a growth stock\n* **Value Metrics:**\n   * **P/E:** \\~31x (Optically high).\n   * **PEG Ratio:** **\\~0.8** Earnings are growing **39% YoY** (Net Income $783M).\n   * **Profitability:** ROE is a massive **31%** \n   * **Cash/Liquidity:** Total Deposits of **$38.8 Billion** vs. a loan portfolio of **$30.4 Billion**.\n* **Thesis:** They are repeating their Brazil playbook in Mexico and Colombia. As those markets turn profitable, the PE ratio will collapse, and earnings will rapidly rise. Fantastic compounder with international diversification. \n\n# 4. Shift4 Payments ($FOUR)\n\n* Integrated payments for hotels, stadiums, and restaurants. Not just a commodity processor; it's the operating system for these venues.\n* **Value Metrics:**\n   * **P/E:** \\~34x Trailing\n   * **PEG Ratio:** On a standard GAAP basis, the PEG looks bad. However, Shift4 is often valued on **Adjusted EBITDA** or **Free Cash Flow**\n   * **Growth:** Q3 Revenue up **61% YoY**; Adjusted EBITDA up **56%**.\n   * **Free Cash Flow:** Adjusted FCF of **$141 Million** in the quarter.\n   * **Debt/Cash:** They have **$1.5B in Cash** against \\~$4.0B in Long-Term Debt. Net leverage is manageable given the cash flow growth\n* **Thesis:** Shift4 is winning enterprise clients (stadiums/hotels) that stick around for years. If you value them on EBITDA/FCF rather than GAAP earnings, they are trading at a significant discount to peers like Toast or Block. Special note that the moat here is deep, not necessarily small with powerful competitors. Shift4's moat is vertical integration. By owning the gateway, the POS software (SkyTab), and the payment rails, they capture the entire stack. I still do not see the competition to be enough that FOUR cannot continue to grow and succeed as a good investment. \n\n# The \"Deep Value\" / Turnaround Plays\n\nClassic value picks trading at distressed multiples due to market sentiment and headwinds.\n\n# 5. Molina Healthcare ($MOH)\n\n* Managed care (Medicaid/Medicare) focused. The stock has been absolutely hammered by regulatory fears, creating a massive margin of safety\n* **The Value Metrics:**\n   * **P/E:** \\~9x (Forward)\n   * **PEG Ratio:** Short-term PEG is very messy due to recent earnings volatility\n   * **Growth:** Earnings missed big in Q3 (-70% YoY) due to higher medical costs. Again, this is another headwind that will clear but has created a deep value opportunity. \n   * **Cash/Debt:** Parent company cash is thin (\\~$108M), but debt leverage remains manageable at \\~0.9x debt-to-equity.\n* **Thesis:** At 9x earnings, the market has already priced in the multiple disasters. If state reimbursement rates stabilize even slightly, this stock re-rates significantly. It's a pure \"fear\" play. In 2025, Molina priced their plans too low, people went to the doctor more than expected, and margins got crushed. Insurance is a self-correcting cycle. When they lose money, they raise prices. Molina is aggressively hiking premiums for 2026 and cutting unprofitable plans. Buying now is investing before the momentum swings back due to improved profit margins. \n\n# 6. Lululemon ($LULU)\n\n* The stock is down big from its highs because the US consumer is slowing, but the brand is far from dead. Expect the international market to pick up the slack of US market\n* **The Value Metrics:**\n   * **P/E:** \\~12.5x. (Used to trade at 40x+)\n   * **PEG Ratio:** Again very messy due to US market decline. This provides a great entry point unless you feel the brand is entirely dead. \n   * **Growth:** Total Revenue still up **9% YoY**, with International up **20%+**\n   * **Balance Sheet:** **$1.2 Billion in Cash** and effectively **Zero Long-Term Debt** (0% Debt-to-Equity)\n* **Thesis:** You rarely get a brand with 58% gross margins trading at 12x earnings. If international growth (China +20%+) continues to compound, the stock doesn't need to grow fast to be a great investment. If the multiple re-rates to just 18x, that’s a 50% gain.  Any improvement in the US market at all will send this much higher very quickly. right now, this is an outsized reward vs risk scenario. \n\nLet me know what you think of these and if you agree or disagree. Together these positions equate to about 45% of my current portfolio. ",

      "title": "Google - not AMD - is Nvidia’s greatest threat because of their full-stack AI and AlphaEvolve",
      "content": "Google - not AMD - is Nvidia’s greatest threat because of their full-stack AI and AlphaEvolve\n\nAMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else, but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company’s conception. Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000: \n\n\"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we had the ultimate search engine, it would understand everything on the web; it would understand, um, you know, exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. And that's obviously artificial intelligence.\"[ Google Co-Founder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI (2000)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OT_Uj2z3Z0) \\- For those that don’t know, it was supposedly Larry Page’s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI.\n\n# Full-stack AI\n\nNow, imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation. Your first thought will probably be: Which should I pick? ChatGPT immediately comes to mind, but you want to do your research properly. Through your research, you find that Google's Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck, at least among American AI models. Plus, they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model. Perfect. Google seems like a good choice. Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity (especially if they improve).\n\nBut what about implementation? Google offers enterprise-ready API:s via Vertex with more features coming like auth, database and payments, Google Cloud for storage, and now even at location TPU:s that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible. Super. Suddenly, your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google, and along the way, you never touch an Nvidia product.\n\nBut before you make your final decision, you ask yourself: Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term, so I don’t get vendor-locked with an inferior offering?\n\nI’ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never want to bet against the man - and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way. I don’t imagine Nvidia is particularly - or really at all - threatened by Google in the short term, though Google's TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices, reducing profit margin. Apparently, OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it, according to[ Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1994468652716859394), worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia. Though what is actually important is not the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future.\n\n# AlphaEvolve\n\nI allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed[ AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/). The evolutionary AI system had, in secret, improved everything from the training of their AI models to Google's hardware, i.e., their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multi-billion dollar deal for them, with Meta considering the same. \n\nThe remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro, not even Gemini 2.5. Today, it’s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations, and in the future, it will use far more powerful models than that. Meaning that the better Google’s AI models get, the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google’s models and hardware. The cheaper and better Google’s hardware, the more powerful models can be built and run. The more powerful the models, the better the hardware. And so on.\n\nBetter AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia’s CUDA moat. One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code, causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA. But once AI models become sufficiently advanced, the programming difficulty may not be a concern, or Google and Gemini create some CUDA-variant of their own. Rumors also exist of them doing just that.\n\n# All in all\n\nThis means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business, it’s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia. If they do it often enough, AI labs will eventually wonder: can you build better AI models without Nvidia? This will be especially true if other AI-labs do it too:[ “resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs”](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/tpuv7-google-takes-a-swing-at-the).\n\nDoes this mean I think Nvidia is done for? Not at all, as I said, I've spent enough time studying Jensen that I'd never want to bet against him. After all, he is a man who roommated with a 17-year-old ex-con covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5-trillion-dollar man. Jensen has a ton of cards to play, and he’s already playing them perfectly.\n\nNvidia still has a hardware/hardware-software lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future. If they make a substantial compute leap, Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia’s AI lab, absorb one of the AI labs, or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race. He is securing long-term deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia. Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development. He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem. Nvidia will likely begin to offer full-stack solutions of its own. And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia, Google and AMD.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I hold a significant long position in Google (Alphabet). The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not constitute financial or investment advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.  \n  \n**TLDR;** Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term, though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin. But over the long term, Google’s full stack offerings - AI models/applications, cloud and TPUs - with AI model’s designed to improve AI models and hardware (AlphaEvolve) getting better, Google might even take a long term lead. Though, Jensen is playing Nvidia’s cards perfectly. ",

The deal, which values the storied movie studio and its HBO Max streaming service at nearly $83 billion, could reshape the entertainment industry, but is also expected to draw scrutiny from regulators.\n\nNetflix stock was down more than 3% recently, while Paramount Skydance shares slid 7%. Warner Bros. Discovery stock rose more than 2%.\n\nIs this a win win for both stocks? should WBD holders be concerned?\n\nMajor tech stocks were mixed. Broadcom (AVGO) and Meta Platforms (META) each gained more than 1%, while Alphabet (GOOG) was marginally higher. Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) traded slightly lower and even platforms like Bitget and others have began encouraging users diversification into stocks with phases of stock futures rush events.\n\nGenerally though, tech giants have regained some of their losses from a volatile November, but most remain well below their recent highs.",

The other 2 RAM companies, Samsung an SK Hyinx will also profit as a whole 1/3rd of their competition in the consumer RAM market disappears completely. The AI Bubble popping would be because AI companies can’t meet expectations, thus not making profits, causing the bubble to pop, or the market crash. But these RAM providers ARE meeting expectations by selling the hardware. If the crash occurs, how would their stocks drop, if they are making profits by selling hardware?\n\nNote: I’m a fairly new investor, so I may be way off the mark with this evaluation.

  "deepseek_market_analysis": "# COMPREHENSIVE MARKET INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-05 20:02:13 | **Time Horizon:** Day\n\n---\n\n## 1. MARKET SENTIMENT: **Cautiously Bullish with Sector-Specific Volatility**\n\nThe overall sentiment is a mix of macro optimism and retail-driven speculative tension. The dominant narrative from financial news is **bullish**, driven by soft inflation data (September core CPI at 2.8%, lower than expected) boosting rate-cut expectations. This is a powerful, positive macro catalyst. However, Reddit sentiment reveals a **fractured retail base**: high engagement on speculative themes (GME, crypto, AI risk) alongside posts showing trader fatigue (\"-75k over 5 years, I'm done\"). The VIX at 15.78 suggests moderate, but not extreme, complacency. **Conclusion:** Institutional sentiment leans bullish on macro data, while retail sentiment is distracted by high-beta, narrative-driven plays, creating a two-tiered market.\n\n## 2. KEY THEMES: **Inflation/Policy, Mega-M&A, and Retail Speculation**\n\n*   **Inflation & Monetary Policy Dominance:** The delayed September core CPI print (2.8%) is the single most important data point, directly fueling rate-cut bets. This theme is corroborated by the top Bloomberg headline and is the foundational bullish signal.\n*   **Transformative Media M&A:** The **Netflix-Warner Bros. Discovery deal ($72B)** is a seismic event, creating a dominant streaming/content entity. Related themes include breakup fees ($5.8B), integration challenges, and the fate of WBD's assets (e.g., sports rights, studios).\n*   **AI & Private Market Froth:** \"Wall Street Races to Cut Its Risk From AI’s Borrowing Binge\" and \"Private Market FOMO Over AI Will Lead to Mistakes\" signal peak excitement and growing risk management concerns in the AI investment space, extending beyond public equities.\n*   **Retail Meme/Crypto Resurgence:** Reddit is actively discussing **GameStop (GME)** (mention of extreme short interest, price action) and crypto (SpaceX's Bitcoin transfer, grisly crypto scammer story). This indicates renewed speculative interest in these asset classes, a classic sign of rising risk appetite at the retail margin.\n*   **Labor Market Crosscurrents:** Conflicting signals exist: record US job cuts (153K in October) vs. strong Canadian job gains. This adds uncertainty to the \"soft landing\" narrative despite the positive inflation trend.\n\n## 3. MARKET SIGNALS & CATALYSTS\n\n*   **Primary Bullish Catalyst:** **Softer-than-expected core inflation (2.8%).** This directly lowers the implied path of the Fed Funds rate, reducing discount rates for equities and supporting valuations. It is the key driver for the broad market rise noted by Bloomberg.\n*   **Major Corporate Catalyst:** **Netflix-WBD Merger.** This is a sector-defining event. **WBD's +6.28% move** reflects deal arbitrage and optimism. The massive breakup fee signals high commitment. This will force reassessments across the entire **Communication Services and Discretionary** sector.\n*   **Contrarian/Risk Signal:** Surging discussion of **GME short interest** and crypto stories on Reddit. Historically, intense retail focus on these assets has coincided with market peaks or periods of high volatility. It is a sentiment indicator worth monitoring for a potential \"risk-off\" trigger.\n*   **Warning Signal:** Headlines about Wall Street cutting AI lending risk and warnings of private market \"FOMO\" mistakes suggest the AI investment cycle may be entering a more mature, selective, and potentially volatile phase.\n\n## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n*   **Primary Risks:**\n    1.  **Retail Speculation Unwind:** A sharp reversal in meme stocks or crypto could spill over into broader market sentiment and hit broker-dealers.\n    2.  **Labor Market Deterioration:** The spike in US job cuts, if confirmed as a trend in upcoming data, could undermine the soft-landing narrative, even with good inflation news.\n    3.  **AI Capital Cycle Slowdown:** If financing for AI startups tightens significantly, it could impact related public tech companies and venture portfolios.\n*   **Primary Opportunities:**\n    1.  **Rate-Sensitive Sectors:** Continued disinflation favors **Technology, Growth, and Real Estate** as longer-duration assets.\n    2.  **M&A Arbitrage & Sector Consolidation:** The Netflix-WBD deal may spur further media/tech consolidation. Stocks perceived as targets or consolidators may see re-ratings.\n    3.  **Short-Term Volatility Plays:** The disconnect between calm macro indices (VIX ~16) and heated retail speculation presents opportunities in volatility products.\n\n## 5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\n\n*   **SECTOR: Communication Services** – **Watch for consolidation plays.** The Netflix-WBD deal validates the \"streaming scale\" thesis. Scrutinize other potential targets (e.g., PARA, DISCA legacy assets) and competitors needing to respond (DIS, CMCSA).\n*   **SECTOR: Technology** – **Adopt a barbell approach.** Favor large-cap, cash-rich tech (beneficiaries of lower rates) but be selective on hyper-growth, cash-burning AI plays due to tightening private funding warnings.\n*   **SYMBOL: WBD** – **Monitor deal progression and regulatory headlines.** The current price move reflects deal probability. The primary risk is regulatory rejection; the $5.8B breakup fee provides a partial floor.\n*   **SYMBOL: GME / Meme Basket** – **Extreme caution advised for non-speculators.** The high short interest and retail attention create potential for explosive, low-liquidity moves. This is a sentiment gauge, not a fundamental investment at this stage.\n*   **MACRO: Federal Reserve Policy** – **Focus on upcoming labor data (next NFP).** The market is pricing a dovish Fed on inflation. Any sign of accelerating wage growth or persistent labor market strength could disrupt this consensus and trigger a sharp reversal.\n*   **ASSET CLASS: Volatility (VIX)** – **Consider long-volatility hedges.** The combination of retail speculation, AI froth, and concentrated market leadership (Mega-cap Tech) increases the risk of a sudden, sharp correction despite the bullish macro backdrop. The VIX at sub-16 may not fully price this tail risk.\n\n---\n**Bottom Line:** The market is being pulled in two directions. A **bullish macro tide** (falling inflation) is lifting all boats, but beneath the surface, **speculative excess** in retail favorites and warnings in AI financing suggest growing fragility. **Tactical positioning in rate beneficiaries and M&A targets is favored, while maintaining hedges against a potential sentiment shock.**",

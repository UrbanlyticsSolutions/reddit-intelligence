      "title": "US Black Friday shoppers expected to spend less as cost of living bites",
      "content": "US Black Friday shoppers expected to spend less as cost of living bites\n\n## Crucial holiday sales period forecast to draw record crowds but with tighter budgets\n\n&gt;Americans are expected to shop in record numbers but spend less money during the crucial sales period around Black Friday as concerns about tariffs and the cost of living make consumers more cautious.\n&gt;\n&gt;A record 187mn people, or more than half of the US population, are expected to shop between Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday and Monday, according to a National Retail Federation survey.\n&gt;\n&gt;But the rate of spending is likely to slow. Consumers surveyed by Deloitte said that they planned to spend $622 on average over that period, down 4 per cent year on year.\n&gt;\n&gt;Black Friday kicks off the frenzied final weeks of the winter holiday shopping season, driving sales that can make or break retailers’ annual profits.\n&gt;\n&gt;This year’s sales come as affordability concerns rise up the US political agenda in the face of stubborn inflation and an uptick in unemployment. Shoppers who planned to tighten their belts cited the higher cost of living and financial constraints, Deloitte said. \n&gt;\n&gt;Rick Gomez, chief commercial officer at Target, said: “As we approach the holidays, we know consumers remain cautious. Sentiment is at a three-year low amid concerns about jobs, affordability and tariffs.”\n&gt;\n&gt;“Yet they remain emotionally motivated. They want to celebrate with loved ones without overspending,” he told analysts last week. \n&gt;\n&gt;US retailers now begin Black Friday promotions weeks earlier than the Friday following Thanksgiving as they blend online and digital commerce.\n&gt;\n&gt;Retail giant Walmart is running three sets of deals this month, the third concluding on Monday. Target’s Black Friday event covers the entire week, offering deals such as half price for some Beats headphones, Instant Pot cookware and Barbie dolls. \n&gt;\n&gt;Executives and analysts have acknowledged the strain on some customers in 2025. “What we are seeing is just a lot of uncertainty in the market and people really feeling higher prices,” said Lupine Skelly, retail research leader at Deloitte.\n&gt;\n&gt;At Kohl’s, the US department store chain, “discretionary income remains pressured. This is especially notable in our low to middle-income consumers, as well as in our younger customers,” Michael Bender, its new chief executive, told analysts this week. “The holidays are always a promotional time period, and we expect this to continue this year, especially given the state of the consumer.”  \n&gt;\n&gt;Annual growth in sales is expected to slow slightly during the holiday season spanning November and December, the NRF forecast, to between 3.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in 2024. Total sales are likely to top $1tn for the first time.\n&gt;\n&gt;Retailers and brands have kicked off promotions well before Thanksgiving. So far this month, online sales have increased by 7.5 per cent year over year to nearly $80bn, according to Adobe Analytics. Comparable data on sales at physical stores is not yet available.\n&gt;\n&gt;Retailers have reported some price rises in order to offset higher costs of imports following the tariffs President Donald Trump imposed on US trading partners this year.\n&gt;\n&gt;Eighty-five per cent of consumers surveyed by the NRF said they expect higher prices for gifts and holiday items because of tariffs. \n&gt;\n&gt;US consumer confidence has dropped to the lowest level since Trump launched the global trade war in April, the Conference Board reported this week, clouding the outlook for future sales.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Much of the expected rise in total spending “reflects higher prices, not higher confidence”, according to consultancy Accenture’s holiday shopping survey.\n&gt;\n&gt;Gift cards will be the top Christmas present this year, followed by apparel and toys or games, a consumer survey by market research firm Numerator showed.\n&gt;\n&gt;Skelly at Deloitte said the preference for gift cards likely showed consumers responding to affordability worries. “When people start experiencing higher prices and talking a lot about it, they tend to go to gift cards,” she said. “What happens is, ‘Hey, I’ll buy you the $50 gift card, and you can go buy the $57 sweater.’ It kind of puts the pressure back on the gift recipient.”\n",

This visionary policy positions Thailand as a serious contender in the global race for crypto dominance, inviting both local enthusiasts and international investors to explore the burgeoning digital asset landscape without the burden of steep taxes.\n\nFor crypto investors looking for fertile ground, Thailand’s initiative is a beacon, signaling a new dawn for digital investment in Southeast Asia. Other Asian based CEXs like Bitget are also making strides providing tokenized US stocks and RWA onchain for users to trade... they added other initiatives like Bitget lucky scratch for users to win 777 USDT and BGB which has also boosted trading activities\n\nOverall, Thailand's innovative tax exemption is more than just a local initiative; it has the potential to resonate on the global stage. Other countries observing Thailand may realize the importance of crafting flexible regulations that can adapt to rapid changes in the crypto landscape. As nations evaluate their own approaches to cryptocurrency, Thailand's proactive stance might act as a catalyst for a sweeping rethinking of tax structures and regulatory frameworks worldwide, as jurisdictions strive to attract investment in this volatile but promising market.",

      "content": "My 0DTE journey so far — up $41k this week and aiming for $1M\n\nThought I’d share my progress so far with 0DTE trading. I’ve been working on this seriously for a while now — studying price action, focusing on clean entries, and trying to stay disciplined. It hasn’t been an overnight thing, and I’ve had plenty of setbacks, but this is the first time I’ve felt like my process is finally paying off.\n\nThis past week was my strongest yet:\n\n# Weekly P/L:\n\n**+ $41,873.95**\n\n# Some trades from the week:\n\n* **SPY 653C (11/21)** – +$3,440\n* **SPY 666C (11/24)** – +$6,330\n* **SPY 669C (11/25)** – +$13,020\n* **SPY 679C (11/26)** – +$8,230\n* **SPXW 6835C (11/28)** – +$17,950\n\nI trade mostly SPY/SPX 0DTE calls based on structure, liquidity zones, and intraday momentum. My main improvement this year has been controlling risk, trading only on the days I’m available (Mon/Wed/Fri), and stopping once I hit goal instead of overtrading.\n\n# Account movement this week:\n\nMy account climbed to around **$34,857** from being down a bit earlier in the week. This is the biggest growth curve I’ve seen since I started trading options.\n\n# The bigger picture:\n\nMy long-term goal is to grow this into a **$1M account** through consistent 0DTE trading. I know the risks, and I’m not pretending this is easy or safe — but I’m documenting the journey and trying to stay as disciplined as possible.\n\nSharing this mainly for transparency and for anyone else grinding through learning price action. I’ll keep updating as I continue the push toward that seven-figure milestone.\n\nScreenshots attached for the numbers.",

After reports came out that Meta is in advanced talks to spend billions on Google’s AI chips instead of Nvidia’s, the company actually put out a statement defending its market position. That rarely happens, and it shows how seriously they’re taking Google’s TPU push. The reaction was immediate Nvidia’s stock took a heavy hit, wiping out around $250B in market value in a day. At the same time, Alphabet shares jumped because Wall Street is starting to see TPUs as a real alternative, not just an internal Google tool. Nvidia still controls more than 90% of the AI accelerator market, so it’s not like they’re suddenly in trouble. But this is one of the first times they’ve been forced into *responding* rather than leading the narrative. According to The Information, Google has been pitching TPUs hard to major clients (including Meta and big financial institutions), and these customers could represent up to 10% of Nvidia’s annual revenue. Feels like the first real crack in Nvidia’s dominance we’ve seen so far. Whether it turns into an actual shift or just short-term noise is what everyone’s watching now.",

It was a no brainer, not adding at the moment.\n- ADBE: entered a position recently, my research shows a lot of the fear comes from retail, they invest in AI much more than people think and can absolutely benefit from it top and bottom line. Will keep buying heavily under 400 as long as earnings are solid.\n- CNSWF: same rationale as ADBE. Working closely with AI in Enterprise software, these companies have more moat than people think.\n-  MELI: small position, solid company, good execution so far and the recent dip seems a good entry point, I like the exposure to higher growth geo.\n- UNH: definitely a big position in my portfolio, bought the dip and added after Daddy Warren bought. Avg $306, not actively buying at the moment \n- NVO: bought regularly on the way down. $53, small position. Not an expert here but my take is the market is huge, they have a good pipeline, long term it should be alright\n- ENPH / FSLR: solar play, high conviction but def. longer term. Down nearly 50% on Enphase decent size position, buying actively as long as financial are solid and long term market seems aligned with the company strategy. Not recommended if you don't have the gut and deep conviction here lol\n\nI don't do crazy amount of research for each. I just look at high level signals, try to remove noise as much as I can and focus on facts to build some good level of conviction so I can manage the down time...\n\nAll this represents around 1/4 of my total assets, rest being in bonds/ETFs buy and hold strategy. \n\nLooking forward to your questions, feedback folks ",

      "title": "Deep Dive: $KEP (Korea Electric Power)",
      "content": "Deep Dive: $KEP (Korea Electric Power)\n\nThis week on the QAV podcast I did a deep dive on **KEP (Korea Electric Power)**, the monster utility that basically *is* the South Korean electricity system. \n\nLast week I covered PCG and Reddit absolutely lit me up, which was hilarious, so I figured: why stop now? Let's do another deeply hated, deeply boring, deeply cash-gushing utility that the market refuses to understand. \n\nKEP is a **regulated monopoly** that generates, transmits, and distributes almost all the electricity in South Korea. Think: every apartment, every Samsung fab, every shipyard, every farm — nearly all of it runs on KEP's grid. They also operate six generation subsidiaries across **coal, gas, nuclear, wind, solar**, and more. They even own coal mines in Australia and miscellaneous energy assets scattered around the world. \n\nGreat backstory: KEP traces its origins to a *royal* electrification project in **1898**, when King Gojong decided Seoul needed streetcars and electric lights. His wife, Queen Min, was even more politically powerful and was later assassinated by Japanese agents in a palace coup so brutal it reads like a prestige-TV pilot. The whole thing morphed through Japanese occupation, American administration, nationalisation, and eventually the modern Kepco we see today. \n\nFast-forward to now: KEP spent 2021–2023 haemorrhaging cash because the Korean government caps retail electricity prices. When fuel costs spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine, KEP had to sell electricity *below cost* for about two years. Losses ballooned, investors panicked, and the stock cratered. \n\nBut the worm has turned. South Korea finally allowed tariff increases in 2023, **nuclear utilisation improved**, new reactors came online, and profitability has bounced back hard. For the first 9 months of 2025 they reported:\n\n**₩11.5 trillion** operating profit\n\n**₩7.3 trillion** net profit\n\nFitch has them at **AA-** with stable outlook From a value perspective:\n\n**Price/Operating Cash Flow:** 1.52 At QAV we'll look at anything &lt;7. This is absurdly cheap for a regulated monopoly. You're basically paying $1.50 for $1 of cash flow.\n\n**Price &lt; Book:** 16.7 vs 25.1 USD-equivalent That's **0.67x book**. Deep value territory.\n\n**Stockopedia F-Score:** 8 Almost perfect. Financial health improving across the board.\n\n**Stock Rank:** 95\n\n**QAV Score:** 0.56 (top of our American buy list last week)\n\n**Quality Score:** \\~80% \n\nYield is low right now (0.43%) because the dividend was slashed during the loss years, but that could change once the regulatory dust settles. \n\nBear case: Government meddling, tariff populism, high capex for reactors, climate litigation, and currency risk (KRW). All true. But at this valuation, the market is pricing KEP like it's dying. It isn't. It's a national utility whose job is to keep a G7-level industrial economy switched on. \n\nBull case: AI and robotics will require *vast* new energy capacity (see what's happening in the US and China). Whether South Korea's future is driven by Samsung, LG, Hyundai, or six companies nobody has heard of yet… all of them will plug into KEP. \n\nBottom line: **KEP is a boring, cash-rich, government-protected electricity monopoly trading at liquidation-sale prices.** If the political and tariff environment remains even moderately sane, this is a lay-down misère. If things turn bad again, we sell it under our rules. Simple. \n\nDisclaimer: Not financial advice. DYOR. \n\n\n\nBTW, if you're following my deep dives, yes, $PCG commenters, it's up 3% since last week. Leading with love.  $MODG from the week before is up 22%.",

That’s not pocket change, that’s serious conviction that Bitcoin is heading up.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is the timing. Bitcoin is sitting around the low $90k range right now and has been pretty volatile lately. This trader is basically betting big that we’re going to see higher prices soon. The position uses leverage too, which means the gains could be huge but so could the losses if things go south.\n\nThe market has definitely been heating up. Daily BTC trading volume is in the high tens of billions of dollars right now, so there’s clearly a lot of activity and interest. Between whales, derivatives and bigger players still taking directional bets, there’s plenty of fuel for more volatility in both directions.\n\nThese kinds of whale moves usually create ripple effects. Other traders see this and it ends up influencing their decisions – sometimes it brings in more buyers, sometimes it just adds even more chaos to the price action.\n\nPersonally I think it’s wild to see someone throw that much money on a leveraged bet. One wrong move and that’s a massive liquidation. But clearly some people are still comfortable taking huge swings at these levels.\n\nAnyone else watching this play out What do you think happens next with Bitcoin",

The part that stood out to me is how much of the early AI demand is coming from internal credits and vendor incentives.

It reminded me a lot of the early cloud stories where companies talked up growth, but the real costs showed up a few quarters later.

      "content": "How Bitcoin turned its “strongest month” into its worst in 7 years...\n\nBitcoin is having one of its worst Novembers since the 2018 bear market and here’s why it’s happening.\n\nSo far this month, Bitcoin is down roughly 17–20%, trading around the $90–92k range. That’s pretty close to the losses from November 2019, when BTC dropped about 17–18%. The worst November on record was back in 2018, with a brutal ~36% crash in the middle of that bear market.\n\nHistorically, November has actually been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, with average returns around 40% in past cycles, so this kind of red November is a big break from the usual pattern. One major structural change this time around is that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs finally launched in January 2024, which pulled a lot of institutional money directly into BTC and may have shifted the timing of the typical post-halving “euphoria” phase.\n\nSince those ETFs went live, institutions and large funds have played a much bigger role in price action, and a lot of analysts think that’s changed the rhythm of this cycle. Instead of the classic script where October and November often rip higher, this year October already closed slightly red and November is now deeply negative despite that historically bullish seasonality.\n\nAnother huge factor has been leverage getting nuked. A ton of traders were running oversized long positions with borrowed money, and when the October and November sell-offs hit, billions of dollars in longs were force-liquidated. That cascade of liquidations amplified the downside and helped drive BTC from an all-time high around $126k in October down into the low $80ks at the worst point of this drawdown.\n\nSome analysts actually see this “flush” as a necessary cleansing process. It shakes out over-leveraged players and weak hands, kills off some of the froth, and can set up a healthier base for the next leg up once the market digests all the forced selling.\n\nOne interesting pattern from the last decade: every time Bitcoin has had a red November, December has also finished red. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but if that pattern holds and you combine it with the usual post-halving correction, it wouldn’t be shocking if real recovery takes time and stretches well into 2026 rather than bouncing straight back in the next few weeks",

Investors appeared to look past the litigation drama, focusing instead on the prospects of securing Apple as a foundry customer, which analysts described as having improved significantly.\n\nIntel led chip stocks higher on Friday, helping drive the broader S&amp;P 500 to gains and turning the index positive for November.

      "content": "At what point would be a long enough time horizon that you’re able say you’re decent at picking individual stocks?\n\nPeople always tell me don’t buy individual stocks you’re better off investing in an index fund, which is why im asking this question. I’ve been investing for almost 9 years, pretty happy with my results so far and have learned a ton along the way. In this account I leave a portion for swing trading (I’m a full time investor and treat this part as my active income), while the rest holding long term stocks. I don’t really diversify in my opinion I usually only hold on to no more than 5-6 stocks and it has worked out so far (these holdings have changed over time as I haven’t held any stock since I started investing). I like to research a ton and have high conviction before investing into something which has rewarded me with some pretty good gains. I’m not sure if I could do this with a diversified portfolio with a ton of companies, so I’m sticking with what has worked for me. I don’t know if I can continue to beat the S&amp;P 500 but hopefully we can keep this journey going haha.\n\nI wanted to post screen shots of my fidelity for proof but it doesn’t allow attachments so I copy and pasted from the screen shots\n\n\n\n\nYour 1-year cumulative pre-tax return \n+265.67%\n\nYour 5-year cumulative pre-tax return\n+508.80%\n\nYour total cumulative pre-tax return\n\n+3,273.12%\nFrom Mar-06-2017 to Nov-26-2025\n\n",

Last year they grew revenue at 82%, this year and fwd guidance expected to be &gt;30%\n\nPros i can think of:\n- mid cap with high growth that should be insulated away from AI stock volatility as they have nothing to do with AI\n\n- no matter the economy (recession or growth) their services are essential.  They have about 20% market share in the organs they serve (heart, lung, liver) and their product has demonstrated to lead to better outcome.  People still need organ transplants if economy stagnants\n\n- end to end exposure for organ transplants.  Besides just selling their organ care system product they have surgeons, airline pilots on payroll to retrieve the organ and put it on one of their 22 airplanes to get to recepient.  Love their solving a painpoint in the process (aka: speed is of necessity)\n\n- really good long term growth potential if can get into kidney (which makes up 90% of waitlist) or international (non USA) markets\n\nCons:\n\n- trading within 15% of all time high\n\n- PEG ratio around 2, which doesnt scream undervalued but for healthcare stocks it always trades at a premium\n\nWhat is everyone's thoughts on TMDX?",

      "content": "Why ADBE Might Actually Thrive In The AI Era Thanks To Its IP Approach\n\nThere is a lot of talk about generative AI disrupting creative work, such as video and photo generation. But I believe Adobe could actually benefit from this shift because of the way it handles data and intellectual property.\n\nFirefly, Adobe’s generative AI, is trained only on content Adobe owns or that is in the public domain. Unlike some AI models that use content scraped without permission, Adobe relies on licensed assets like Adobe Stock. This gives them a clear legal advantage.\n\nAdobe also clarified in its terms of use that it will not use customer content to train AI models. This means anything users create or upload stays private and is not fed back into AI training. This level of legal certainty could be very appealing to professionals and businesses worried about possible IP and copyright infringement in their work.\n\nAs lawsuits over unlicensed data inevitably increase when regulatory finally catches up with the technology, Adobe’s reputation for legal compliance and transparency becomes an asset. They are also implementing content provenance and metadata tracking, which shows authorship and AI involvement. This kind of accountability could be a major differentiator.\n\nIt would be fair to mention that Google and Meta has probably the most valuable video (Youtube) and photo (Instagram) data sets in the world. And their fine print in their Terms of Service gives them the rights to use that content, but that could definitely be pressured in the future. But Adobe also has its entire Adobe stock data sets its AI trains on which gives uses confidence that they should not have to worry about copyright infringement, etc. \n\nWhile some smaller AI companies may be more exposed to future legal and copyright risks, Adobe’s approach could allow it not just to survive but to thrive.",

After its 2026 Q1 earnings it reported positive figures, and its stock price went up. But over time investors started selling the stock, causing its price to go down, out of fear of the risk its RPOs and debt presented. I wonder if a similar pattern might happen in Q2.\n\nThis seems similar to bonds or tbill ETFs where they start going up until a maturity date (due to credit risk) at which point it crashes and the cycle restarts. Similarly, buying the dip has the highest risk and also the highest potential return, ",
